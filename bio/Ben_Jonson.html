        <h1>Ben Jonson</h1>

        <p> Ben Jonson was a close friend to John Donne for much of his life and one of the few of Donne’s
            associates whose comments on Donne survive (apart from elegies). A near contemporary of Donne’s,
            Jonson came from a similar background as the son of a London tradesman. Jonson’s biological father
            died when he was young and he took on the trade of his mother’s new husband, working as a bricklayer
            at various times throughout his life.42 Jonson eventually left that trade to pursue a career as a
            dramatist and poet: he achieved great success in these endeavours and is often labelled as England’s
            “First Poet Laureate” because he received an annual pension from King James for his work. Jonson was
            distinct from his contemporaries in that he actually sought and curated his persona as a published
            author when there was still stigma attached to professional writers. Donne, for instance, frequently
            voiced his resistance to print publication.43 Jonson and Donne shared considerable overlap in their
            social and literary circles despite this difference: both were members of the Sirenaical society, and
            both were clients under the patronage of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford.
            <br/><br/>The friendship between Jonson and Donne, along with their similar origins, makes a comparison
            of these two poets a useful exercise that can highlight their differences as writers. Jonson’s writing
            hinges upon a conservative neoclassicism that features an almost slavish faithfulness to the models of
            Roman poets, especially Horace. Donne rules over the “monarchy of Witt” and demonstrates a talent for
            innovation in his metaphysical conceits. Praise of Jonson, on the other hand, describes him as an
            “innovator” for how fully he can follow the models set by the Ancients.44 One might consider it odd
            that Jonson does not demonstrate a greater affinity for Ciceronian models in his writing, but his
            foremost preoccupation was in achieving status as a poet and dramatist, and Cicero’s influence is
            primarily as a political rhetorician and prose writer. Jonson’s models were therefore classical
            writers like Horace and Martial. There are significant distinctions between Donne and Jonson in
            this regard: Jonson self-curated his works as a published author in print, while Donne makes it
            clear in private correspondence that he was reluctant to seek print publication of his poetry and
            instead aspired to civic and political success. In other words, Jonson adheres to the models of
            Horace and other Roman poets and dramatists because his aspirations are literary; Donne leans more
            heavily into certain rhetorical models of Cicero because many of his motivations are overtly civic,
            political, and above all, social.

            <br/><br/>Donne and Jonson wrote verse about each other that suggests their relationship was
            one of admiration and respect. Donne wrote dedicatory verse for Jonson commemorating Jonson’s play,
            Volpone, and Jonson wrote two epigrams on Donne. Moreover, Jonson references Donne in his recorded
            conversations with William Drummond of Hawthornden more than any other author.46 Despite the somewhat
            flippant nature of Jonson’s comments in his dialogue with Drummond, these works leave us with every
            indication that Donne and Jonson shared a close friendship and mixed in many of the same social and
            literary groups, making them excellent comparators and counterpoints to one another as writers.
            Though no extant correspondence between Donne and Jonson survives, each of these writers’ works
            experienced a kind of literary sociability with the other as they frequently circulated in the same
            manuscripts and literary circles. That compilers and readers associated these authors with one another
            is clear and provides further context for the perception of Donne’s verse letters.
