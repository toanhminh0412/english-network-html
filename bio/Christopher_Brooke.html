        <h1>Christopher Brooke</h1>

        <p> All extant evidence suggests that Christopher Brooke was John Donne’s oldest and closest friend.
            Unfortunately for scholars, the written record of that friendship is relatively sparse because Donne and Brooke
            lived relatively close to one another for much of their lives: the two shared chambers at Lincoln’s Inn (where
            they first met) and lived across the street from one another on Drury Lane in London from 1617 until Brooke’s
            death.31 Brooke was witness to John Donne’s wedding to Anne (Brooke’s brother, Samuel, officiated) and was
            imprisoned for his involvement. Donne and Brooke’s intimate friendship appears to have carried on until Brooke’s
            death. In the version of Brooke’s will recorded in The Complete Poems of Christopher Brooke, the author bequeaths
            certain paintings to Donne among a list of Brooke’s family and close friends: “I giue vnto my deere ancient and
            worthie friend Dcor Dunn the Deane Pawles my picture of the ladie Elizabeth her grace the Countesse of
            Southampton, my lady Anne Wallop, and my lady Isabella Smith.”32 That Donne appears in a list among Brooke’s
            closest friends and family as a recipient of even a portion of Brooke’s estate, along with the language of
            “my deere ancient and worthie friend” that Brooke uses to describe Donne, demonstrates just how closely connected
            the pair stayed throughout their lives.
            </br></br>
            In many ways, Christopher Brooke was able to achieve the secular career to which Donne aspired.
            After attending university, possibly at Cambridge, Brooke was deeply involved with Lincoln’s Inn almost until
            death.33 Brooke served as the representative for York for over two decades as an active and vocal member of
            parliament. He was also a member of the Virginia company: he invested in the Company and became a member of
            its council in 1609, and he provided legal counsel and political advocacy until the company’s dissolution in 1624
            Donne was himself an honorary member of the council of the Virginia Company and, though he never held shares in the
            company, he delivered a sermon to the Virginia Company in 1622.35 Brooke, like Donne and Jonson, was also a member
            of the Sirenaical society that attended the Mermaid tavern. The majority of Brooke’s verse seems to have a
            political bent: among other politically charged poems like his Poem on the Late Massacre in Virginia, Brooke is
            credited as having co-written “The Parliament Fart,” a topical libel on Henry Ludlow that was popular among verse
            collectors, and his Legend of Richard the Third is a warning against monarchical overreach.

            <br/><br/>In addition to two of Donne’s most popular verse letters, Storm and Calm, Donne wrote the lesser-known
            CB to Christopher Brooke as well. All three of these poems to Brooke invoke Donne’s affection for him and allude
            to how unaccustomed the pair are to be separated. Storm in particular notes how badly Donne simultaneously wishes
            to see his friend but also keep him from harm. Donne’s correspondence, while not comprehensive, is an artifact
            embodying an intimate friendship.
