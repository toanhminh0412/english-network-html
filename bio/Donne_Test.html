            <h1>John Donne</h1>

            <p> Born in 1571/72 in London to John and Elizabeth Donne(n√©e Heywood),
                John Donne was the son of two Catholic recusants. He attended Oxford and Cambridge as a young boy,
                then entered Lincoln's Inn in his early twenties to study the law. Donne was secretary to the
                Lord Keeper Sir Thomas Egerton, a soldier during Raleigh's naval expedition to Spain, a member
                of British Parliament, and the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, during which time he
                preached over a hundred sermons that still survive in writing. An exceptional amount of Donne's
                writing still survives today, from solitary letters, to sermons and theological essays, to
                love poems and the raucous poetry of his youth.
