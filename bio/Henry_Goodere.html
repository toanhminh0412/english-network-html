<h1> Sir Henry Goodere (15??-16??)</h1>

Sir Henry Goodere was an intimate friend of John Donne’s over twenty-five years.26 Their professional
interests overlapped as both Goodere and Donne sought similar civic posts in their early careers, and
both served as members of parliament (Goodere in 1604, Donne in 1601 and 1614). Goodere enjoyed moderate
wealth and success for much of his life, but these achievements were usually outpaced by his spending habits.
He received the Polesworth estate through marriage to his first cousin, Frances Goodere, and was a gentleman
of the privy chamber during the reign of King James I and VI, as well as a minister of parliament.27 Goodere
received a knighthood while in service to Robert Devereux, second Earl of Essex, and was an attendant to the
Earl of Hertford during an embassy to Brussels. Despite these preferments and opportunities, Goodere lived an
expensive lifestyle that saw him in debt at the end of his life: Lucy Russell aided by paying part of the dowry
for her god-daughter (Henry’s daughter), Lucy Goodere, and John Donne even helped pay for the debts of Goodere’s
son, John, after the latter had been imprisoned.28 Goodere shared many friends in common with Donne, including
the poet’s patron Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, and Donne’s close friend, Christopher Brooke. He was also
a friend to many other poets such as Michael Drayton and Ben Jonson and frequented the meetings of literary types
at the Mitre Tavern.
