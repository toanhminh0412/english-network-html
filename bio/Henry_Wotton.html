        <h1>Henry Wotton</h1>

        <p> <br/><br/>Sir Henry Wotton was another one of Donne’s lifelong friends and their careers had similar
            trajectories until Donne married Anne More. Wotton served as secretary to the Earl of Essex
            during his exile but before his rebellion. Wotton’s secretaryship overlapped with Donne’s own
            service as secretary to Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper. As a result, though they likely met at
            Oxford during their teenage years, Wotton and Donne would have crossed paths professionally as
            their respective masters had close associations with one another and both Egerton and Essex were
            members of Queen Elizabeth’s star chamber.37 Wotton primarily served Essex as a liaison for
            information with the various contacts he had made during his time travelling Europe. Like Donne,
            Wotton participated in the 1596 Cadiz expedition and Essex’s expedition to the Azores in 1597.


            <br/><br/>Wotton left Essex’s service shortly before the Earl’s rebellion and in 1601 found himself acting
            as a spy in the service of the grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand I, on a mission to deliver the
            antidote to a poison that the latter suspected was to be used in a plot against King James VI of
            Scotland. Wotton’s role in this rescue likely contributed to his appointment as English ambassador
            to Venice and a subsequent knighthood.38 Wotton would continue to serve in the role of ambassador
            to various countries for nearly twenty years before serving as provost of Eton College until his
            death in 1639, outliving Donne by eight years.

            <br/><br/>Wotton and Donne’s extant correspondence is unique in that it includes verse letters written by
            both parties as well as prose.39 Donne wrote four verse letters to Wotton (more than any other
            close friend), including the famously popular “Sir, More then Kisses” (HWKiss), as well as over
            a dozen prose letters. One extant verse letter from Wotton to Donne survives, as well as four
            potential prose letters.40 Their correspondence is an excellent witness to their friendship and
            their verse letter exchange in particular displays Donne exercising the rhetoric of friendship
            during a tumultuous time in English politics, the Earl of Essex’s exile and subsequent rebellion.41
