    <h1>Lucy Russell, Lady Bedford</h1>

    <p> While he wrote verse letters for other patrons (e.g., Magdalen Herbert), Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, was Donne’s longest and most prominent patron. Born Lucy Harington, daughter of the First Baron of Harington, Lucy received a considerable education that included training in Italian, French, Spanish, and possibly Latin or even Greek.57 At the age of just fourteen years old Lucy married Edward Russell, Earl of Bedford, who was seven years her senior. Lucy’s husband incurred great debts, including a £10,000 fine for his role in the Earl of Essex’s rebellion. The couple fell out of favour at court as a result (Edward was even under a form of house arrest), and it was Lucy, not Edward, who would work her way back into the social graces of the court upon the arrival of King James I and VI.58 Lucy quickly earned the favour of Queen Anne by travelling to Scotland before most others to welcome her to court and spent much of her time currying favour with members of court to pay back her estate’s considerable debt.59 Lucy’s proactive role in Bedford affairs only increased when her husband experienced a debilitating horse-riding accident from which he never fully recovered in 1613.
      <br/>
      <br/>Lucy was a patron of the arts and learning and included many famous poets in her circle including Ben Jonson, Michael Drayton, and Samuel Daniel, but she also collected classical artifacts such as coins, paintings, music, and masques.60 John Donne became Lucy’s client around 1607, and the pair had a close relationship that included Lucy writing poetry that Donne read.61
