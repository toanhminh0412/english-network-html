        <h1>Rowland Woodward</h1>

        <p> Rowland Woodward was another of Donne’s good friends whose relationship with our poet lasted the
            majority of their lives.48 Woodward was born the eldest of eight children in London in August of 1573,
            in the same city and within the same year as Donne.49 Woodward and Donne most likely met at Lincoln’s
            Inn, which Woodward entered in 1591. Woodward’s career was not an auspicious one, but it did carry its
            share of intrigue: his posts include diplomatic secretary, deputy clerk in the Signet Office, and
            deputy to the master of ceremonies at court, but Woodward’s most intriguing occupation was as a spy.
            In 1605, Woodward was imprisoned by the Inquisition while conducting espionage in Milan and “attacked
            by robbers in France and left for dead” in 1607 while carrying dispatches home from Venice.

            <br/><br/>He recovered from this attack in France before returning home. There is little else of note
            in what is known of Woodward’s career apart from these two exciting events, and he seems to have spent
            the twilight of his life in service of the Earl of Westmorland.52 Woodward died in 1636, outliving
            Donne by five years.

            <br/><br/>Apart from the verse letters Donne wrote to Woodward (and the verse letter he potentially
            wrote to Donne), Rowland Woodward is perhaps most well known as the scribe of the Westmoreland
            Manuscript (NY3). Little of his verse survives but, along with whatever poems he may have written to
            Donne, Woodward also composed poems in English to commemorate the birth of Charles II and four Latin
            poems: his own epitaph, an epitaph upon the death of Sir Edward Rosseter, and two others. In addition
            to fostering a friendship with Donne, Woodward also shared many of the poet’s friends. For instance,
            he served as Sir Henry Wotton’s secretary during the latter’s ambassadorship to Venice starting in
            1604 and Donne was friends with and wrote verse letters to Rowland’s younger brother, Thomas.
            Rowland also seems to have had some acquaintance and perhaps even a friendship with Ben Jonson,
            to whom he gave a copy of a book by Petrus Bertius.55 In his correspondence with Sir Thomas
            Roe—another mutual friend—Woodward expresses to Roe that from London he might give Roe news of mutual
            friends. Woodward’s communication with Roe intimates to Woudhuysen that the two likely
            “moved in similar circles” and perhaps shared an association with the ‘Sireniacs’, one-time
            literary patrons of the Mermaid Tavern.56 Given the available evidence, Donne’s verse letters to
            Rowland Woodward, very likely written during their Inns of Court days, are the familiar
            correspondence of close friends who had every reason to honestly communicate with one another
            in friendship while challenging each other intellectually. And, as we shall see, the verse letters
            these men shared, particularly Donne’s RWSlumb, support the idea of Woodward and Donne as closely
            connected friends challenging and elevating one another.
