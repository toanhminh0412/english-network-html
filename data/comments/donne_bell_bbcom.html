<h1><i>BB</i> ("Sir, More then kisses")</h1>
<h2>General Introduction</h2>

<p> One of Donne's most popular verse letters, “Sir, More then Kisses” combines Cicero's classical model of friendship
  with contemporary discourses comparing the environments of country, court, and city, all while engaging in a topical
  conversation about the latest political row between Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex.
  Donne employs language from two of Cicero's major works in the poem, maintaining allusions to classical models for
  friendship and the world throughout.
  <br/><br/>
  Donne very likely wrote <i>HWKiss</i> in the late summer of 1598, just after Queen Elizabeth banished the Earl of
  Essex from Court (and Wotton along with him). His initial address to Wotton and his protracted metaphor about the
  particular vices specific to country, court, and city allude to Cicero while reasserting his connection with Wotton
  and subtly cautioning his friend about his precarious political circumstances. The former, akin to the address to
  Chrisopher Brooke in <i>Storm</i>, asserts a bond of amity between correspondents via a common vocabulary, all while
  applying to Donne every bit of praise he will confer to Wotton near the end of the poem.
  <br/><br/>
  The letter also cunningly adapts the well-known cosmological structure of the earth found in <i>Somnium Scipionis</i> to a
  metaphor concerning the vice-laden environments of Renaissance England. The result is a letter mingled with the
  language of both an influential classical author of the English Renaissance and the two members of one of the most
  renowned friendships in history that also engages with popular tropes of Renaissance poetry. </p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><b>1. Sir, More then kisses...</b> Donne makes a daring claim in the opening line of this verse letter, juxtaposing the
  romantic and fraternal sharing of souls and asserting that friendship's medium of the letter surpasses the romantic
  medium of the kiss because the former works even at a distance.</p>
<p><b>2. The tediousness of my Life...</b> Donne wrote this letter before he was blacklisted from the
  professional and political sphere for eloping with his Wife, Anne More. However, he still clearly articulates a
  dissatisfaction in his present position and a reliance on his friends for spiritual and mental sustainment.</p>
<p><b>3 . Ideate</b> To create or construct something as an idea. The <i>OED</i> recognizes Donne's <i>Pseudo-Martyr
</i> as the earliest recorded use of the term, but this poem's composition predates that work by nearly two decades.</p>
<p><b>4 . I should wither in one day and pas...</b></p>
