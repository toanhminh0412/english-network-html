<h1><i>RWEnvy</i> ("Kindly I envy thy Songs perfection")</h1>
<h2>General Introduction</h2>

<p>In this location you will read a general introduction to the poem.

<p><b>3 . Ideate</b> To create or construct something as an idea. The <i>OED</i> recognizes Donne's <i>Pseudo-Martyr
</i> as the earliest recorded use of the term, but this poem's composition predates that work by nearly two decades.</p>
<p><b>4 . I should wither in one day and pas...</b></p>
