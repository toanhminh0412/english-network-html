<br/>  Maddam,
<br/>
<br/>That I might make your Cabinet my Tombe
<br/>  And for my fame, which I loue next my soule,
<br/>  Next to my soule provide the happiest roome,
<br/>  Admitt to that place this last Funerall scroule.
<br/>  Others by Testament giue Legacyes, but I
<br/>  Dyinge, of you doe begge a Legacy.

<br/>  My Fortune and my choice this Custome breake,
<br/>  When we are speechles growne, to make stones speake
<br/>  Though no stone tell thee what I was; yet thou
<br/>  In my Graues inside see what thou art nowe,
<br/>  Yet th'art not yet soe good: till vs Death lay
<br/>  To ripe and mellowe there, w'are stubborne clay:
<br/>  Parents make vs earth, and soules dignify
<br/>  Vs to be glasse; heere to growe gold we ly,
<br/>  Whilst in our soules sinne bred and pampered is,
<br/>  Our soules become worme-eaten carkases.
<br/>  Soe we our selues miraculously destroy
<br/>  Heere, bodyes, with lesse miracle, enioy
<br/>  Such priviledges, enabled heere to scale
<br/>  Heav'n, when the Trumpetts ayre shall them exhale.
<br/>  Heare this, and mend thy selfe, and thou mend'st me
<br/>  By making me, beinge dead, doe good to thee
<br/>  And thinke me well compos'd, that I cold nowe
<br/>  A last sicke houre to syllables allowe.
