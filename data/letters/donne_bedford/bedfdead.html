<h3>To the Countesse of Bedford begun in France; but neuer perfected.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>  Though I bee dead and buried, yett I haue
<br/>  (Liuing in yow) court enough in my Graue
<br/>  As oft as there I thinke my selfe too bee,
<br/>  So manie resurrections waken mee
<br/>  That thankfullnes your fauours haue begott
<br/>  In mee, embalmes mee, that I doe nott rott;
<br/>  This Season, as tis Easter, as tis Spring
<br/>  Must both to Growth, and to Confession bring
<br/>  My thoughts, disposd vnto your Influence: so
<br/>  These Verses bud, so these Confessions grow;
<br/>  First I confesse, I haue to others lent
<br/>  Your stock, and overprodigally spent
<br/>  Your Treasure; for since I had never knowne
<br/>  Vertue, or Beawtie, but as they are growne
<br/>  In yow, I should not thinke, or saie, they shine
<br/>  (So as I haue) in any other Mine.
<br/>  Next I confesse, this my Confession
<br/>  For tis some fault thus mvch to touch vppon
<br/>  Your praise to you; where halfe rights seeme to mvch,
<br/>  And make your mindes sincere Complexion blush.
<br/>  Next I confesse my Impenitence; for I
<br/>  Can scarse repent my first fault, since thereby
<br/>  Remote, low Spiritts, which shall nere read yow
<br/>  May in lesse lessons finde enough to doe,
<br/>  By studyinge copies, not Originalls
<br/>  Desunt Caetera
