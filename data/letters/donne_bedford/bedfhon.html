<h3>To the Countess of Bedford</h3>
<br/>  Honour is soe sublime Perfection
<br/>  And soe refin'd, that when God was alone
<br/>  And Creatureless, at first himself had none
<br/>  But as of th'Elements, these which wee tread,
<br/>  Produce all things with which wee'are Ioye'd, or fed,
<br/>  And those are barren both aboue our head.
<br/>  Soe from lowe Persons doth all honour flowe;
<br/>  Kings, whom they would haue honour'd, to vs showe
<br/>  And but direct our Honour, not bestowe.
<br/>  For when from herbes the pure parts must bee wonn
<br/>  From grosse by stilling, this is better done
<br/>  By despis'd Dunge, then by the fire or Sun.
<br/>  Care not then Madame howe lowe your praiers lye;
<br/>  In labou'rers Ballads oft more peity
<br/>  God finds, then in Te Deum's melodie.
<br/>  And Ord'nance rais'd on Towres, soe many Mile
<br/>  Send not their voice, nor last soe long a while
<br/>  As fires from th'earths Lowe vaults in Sicill Isle.
<br/>  Should I say I liu'd Darker then were true
<br/>  Your Radiation can all Clowds subdue
<br/>  But one, t'is best light, to Contemplate you.
<br/>  You, for whose Bodie God made better claye
<br/>  Or tooke soules stuff, such as shall late decaye
<br/>  Or such as needs small change at the last daye,
<br/>  This, as an Amber-dropp enwrapps a Bee,
<br/>  Couering discouers your gross soule, that wee
<br/>  May in your through-shine front, your hearts thoughts see.
<br/>  You teach (though wee learne not) a thing vnknowne
<br/>  To our late times: the vse of specular stone
<br/>  Through which all things within, without were showne,
<br/>  Of such were Temples, soe, and of such you are;
<br/>  Being, and seeming is your equall Care
<br/>  And Virtues whole summe is but knowe, and dare.
<br/>  Discretion is a wise mans soule, and soe
<br/>  Religion is a Christians, and you knowe
<br/>  How these are one, her yea is not her noe.
<br/>  But as our Soules of Growth, and soules of Sence
<br/>  Haue Birth-right of our Reasons soule; yet hence
<br/>  They fly not from that, nor seeke Presidence,
<br/>  Natures first lesson, soe Discretion
<br/>  Must not grudge Zeale a place, nor yet keepe none,
<br/>  Not Banish it self, nor Religion.
<br/>  Nor may wee hope to soder, still, and knitt
<br/>  These two, and dare to breake them; nor must witt
<br/>  Bee Colleague to Relgion; but bee it.
<br/>  In those poore Types of God (round Circles) soe
<br/>  Religions Types, the peeceless Centers flowe
<br/>  And are in all the Lines, which alwayes goe.
<br/>  If euer either wrought in you alone
<br/>  Or Principally, then Religion
<br/>  Wrought your Ends, and your wayes Discretion.
<br/>  Goe thither still; Goe the same way you went
<br/>  Whoe soe would Chaunge, doe Couet, or Repent
<br/>  Neither can reach you, Great, and Innocent.
<br/>  Finis.
