<h3> To the Countesse of Bedford</h3>
<br/>  Madame, /Reason is our Soules left-hand, Faith her Right,
<br/>  By these wee reach Diuinity, that's you.
<br/>  Their Loues, whoe haue the Blessing of your sight
<br/>  Grewe from their Reason, Mine, from farre Faith grewe.
<br/>  But as although a squint left-handedness
<br/>  Bee'vngratious, yet wee cannot want that hand
<br/>  Soe would I not to'encrease, but to expresse
<br/>  My Faith, as I beleiue, soe vnderstand.
<br/>  Therefore I study you, First in your Saints,
<br/>  Those friends, whom your election glorifies,
<br/>  Then, in your deeds, Accesses, and Restraints
<br/>  And what you reade, and what your self deuise.
<br/>  But soone the Reasons why y'are lou'd by All
<br/>  Grow infinite, and soe pass Reasons reach
<br/>  Then back againe t'implicite Faith I fall
<br/>  And rest on what the Catholique voice doth teach,
<br/>  That you are good; and not one Heretique
<br/>  Denies it: if hee did, yet you are soe;
<br/>  For Rockes which high-topp'd, and deepe rooted stick
<br/>  Waues wash, not vndermine, nor ouerthrowe.
<br/>  In euery thing there naturally growes
<br/>  A Balsamum, to keepe it fresh, and newe,
<br/>  If t'were not iniur'd by extrinsique blowes
<br/>  Your Birth, and beauty are this Balme in you,
<br/>  But you of Learning, and Religion
<br/>  And virtue, and such Ingredients haue made
<br/>  A Methridate, whose operation
<br/>  Keepes off, or cures what can bee done, or saide.
<br/>  Yet this is not your Phisique, but your Foode,
<br/>  A Diet fitt for you, for you are heare
<br/>  The first good Angell, since the worlds frame stood
<br/>  That euer did in womans shape appeare.
<br/>  Since you are then Gods Masterpeece, and soe
<br/>  His Factor for our Loues, Doe, as you doe,
<br/>  Make your returne home Gratious; and bestowe
<br/>  This life on that, soe make one life of twoe;
<br/>  For soe God help mee, I would not miss you there
<br/>  For all the Good, which you can doe mee heere.
