<h3> To the Countesse of Bedford </h3>
<br/>  Madam,/ Yow haue refind mee; and to worthiest thinges
<br/>  Vertue, Art, Beautie, Fortune now I see
<br/>  Rarenes, or vse, not Nature Value bringes
<br/>  And such as they are circumstancd they bee;
<br/>  Two ills can never perplexe vs, Sinne to excuse
<br/>  But of two good thinges, wee may leaue and chuse.
<br/>  Therfore att court, which is not vertues clime,
<br/>  Where a transendent height (as lownes mee)
<br/>  Makes her nott bee, or nott show, All my Rime
<br/>  Your vertues chalenge, which there rarest bee.
<br/>  For as darke Textes neede Notes, there Some mvst bee
<br/>  To vsher Vertue, and saie; This is shee.
<br/>  So in the Countrie is bewty. To this place
<br/>  Yow are the Season, Madam, yow the Daie
<br/>  Tis but a graue of Spices, till your face
<br/>  Awake them, and a thick close bud displaie.
<br/>  Widdowd, and reclusd els, her Sweetes she enshrines
<br/>  As China, when the Sun att Brasill dines.
<br/>  Out from your Chariott, Morninge breakes att night
<br/>  And falsifies both computations, so,
<br/>  Since a new world doth rise here from your light
<br/>  Wee your new Creatures, by new reckoninges goe.
<br/>  This showes that yow from nature lothlye straie
<br/>  That suffer nott an Artificiall daie.
<br/>  In this yow haue made your Court the Antipodes
<br/>  And will'd your Deligate, the Vulgar Sun
<br/>  To doe profane Autumnall Offices,
<br/>  Whilst here to yow wee sacrifisers rvnne.
<br/>  And whether Priests, or Orgaines, yow wee obay
<br/>  Wee sound your Influence, and your Dictates say.
<br/>  Yett to that Dietye, which dwells in you
<br/>  Your Vertuous Soule, I now not sacrifice,
<br/>  These are Petitions, and nott Himmes; They sue
<br/>  But that I may seruaie the Edifice;
<br/>  In all Religions as mvch care hath bin
<br/>  Of Temples, frames, and Beawtie, as Rites within
<br/>  As all which goe to Rome, do not thereby
<br/>  Esteeme Religions, and hold fast the Best,
<br/>  But serue discourse, and curiositie
<br/>  With that, which doth Religion but invest;
<br/>  And shun the Intangling Laberinthes of Schooles
<br/>  And make itt Witt to thinke the wiser fooles.
<br/>  So in this Pilgrimage I would behold
<br/>  Yow, as you are Vertues Temple nott as shee,
<br/>  What walls of tender Cristall her vnfold,
<br/>  What eies, hands, bosome, her pure Altares bee.
<br/>  And after this suruaie, oppose to all
<br/>  Bablers of Chappells, yow the' Escuriall.
<br/>  Yett not as Consecrate, but Meerely as faire
<br/>  On thes I cast a lay, and Country Eie.
<br/>  Of past, and future Stories, which are rare,
<br/>  I finde yow all Record, all Prophecie.
<br/>  Purge but the Booke of Fate, that itt admitt
<br/>  No sad nor guiltie Legends, yow are itt.
<br/>  If good, and louely were not one, of both
<br/>  Yow were the Transcript, and Originall;
<br/>  The Elementes, the Parent, and the Growth
<br/>  And every peece of yow, is both their All.
<br/>  So intire are all your deedes, and yow, that yow
<br/>  Must doe the same thinge still; yow cannott two.
<br/>  But these (as nice thinne Schoole-Diuinitie
<br/>  Serues Heresie to furder, or repres)
<br/>  Tast of Poetique rage or Flatterie;
<br/>  And need not where all hartes one truth profes.
<br/>  Oft from new proofes, and new phrase, new doubts growe;
<br/>  A strange attire aliens the Men wee knowe.
<br/>  Leavinge then busie praise, and all appeale
<br/>  To higher Courts, Sences decree is true;
<br/>  The Mine, the Magazin, the Common weale
<br/>  The Storie of Beawtie'in Twicknam is, and yow
<br/>  Who hath seene one, would both; as who had bin
<br/>  In Paradise, would seeke the Cherubin.
