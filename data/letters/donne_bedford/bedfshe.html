<h3> Elegie to the Lady Bedford </h3>
<br/>  You, that are shee, and you, thats double shee,
<br/>  In her dead face, half of your selfe shall see;
<br/>  Shee was the other part, for soe they doe
<br/>  Which build them friendshipps, become one of twoe.
<br/>  Soe twoe that but themselues noe third can fitt
<br/>  Which were to bee soe, when they were not yet
<br/>  Twinns, though their Birth Cusco, and Musco take,
<br/>  As diuers starrs one Constellation make,
<br/>  Payr'd like twoe eyes, haue equall motion, soe
<br/>  Both but one meanes to see, one way to goe.
<br/>  Had you die'd first, a Carcass, shee had beene
<br/>  And wee your ritch Tombe in her face had seene;
<br/>  Shee, like the soule is gone, and you heare stay
<br/>  Not a liue friend, but th'other half of claye
<br/>  And since you act that part, as men say, here
<br/>  Lyes such a Prince, when but one part is there;
<br/>  And doe all honour, and deuotion due
<br/>  Vnto the whole, soe wee all reuerence you.
<br/>  For such a friendshipp whoe would not adore
<br/>  In you, who are all what both was before?
<br/>  Not all, as if some perished by this,
<br/>  But soe, that in you all contracted is.
<br/>  As of this All, though many parts decaye
<br/>  The pure which Elemented them shall staye.
<br/>  And though diffus'd, and spread in infinite
<br/>  Shall recollect, and in one all vnite.
<br/>  Soe Madam, as her soule to heauen is fledd
<br/>  Her fleash rests in the earth, as in a bed
<br/>  Her virtues doe as to their proper spheare
<br/>  Returne to dwell with you, of whom they were,
<br/>  As perfect motions are all circular
<br/>  Soe they to you their Sea, whence less streames are.
<br/>  Shee was all spices, you all mettalls; soe
<br/>  In you two, wee did both ritch Indies knowe.
<br/>  And as noe fire, nor rust, can spend, or wast
<br/>  One dramm of gold, but what was first shall last,
<br/>  Though it bee forc'd in Water, Earth, salt, Aire,
<br/>  Expans'd in infinite, none will impaire;
<br/>  Soe to your self you may additions take,
<br/>  But nothing can you less, or changed make.
<br/>  Seeke not in seeking newe, to seeme to doubt
<br/>  That you can match her, or not bee without;
<br/>  But let some faithfull book in her roome bee
<br/>  Yet but of Iudith, noe such booke as shee.
