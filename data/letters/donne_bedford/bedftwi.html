<h3> To the Countesse of B:/ att New=Yeares tide. </h3>

<br/>  This twylight of two yeares, not past, nor next
<br/>  Some Embleme is of mee, or I of this:
<br/>  Who Meteor like, of stuffe, and forme perplext
<br/>  Whose what and where in disputation is,
<br/>  If I should call mee any thinge, should misse.
<br/>  I summe the yeares, and mee; and finde mee nott
<br/>  Debtor, to the Old, nor Creditor to new;
<br/>  That cannot saie, my thanks, I haue forgott
<br/>  Nor trust I this with hopes: and yett scarse true,
<br/>  This brauerie is, since these tymes shewd mee yow.
<br/>  In recompence I would shew future tymes
<br/>  What yow were, and teach them, to vrge toward such,
<br/>  Verse embalmes Vertue, And Tombes or thrones of Rimes
<br/>  Preserue fraile transitorie Fame, as mvch
<br/>  As Spice doth bodies, from corrupt aires touch.
<br/>  Mine are short liud: The tincture of your name
<br/>  Creates in them, but dissipates as fast
<br/>  New Spiritts, for stronge Agents, with the same
<br/>  Force that doth warme, And cherish vs, doth wast;
<br/>  kept hott with strong extracts, no bodies last.
<br/>  So my verse, built of your iust praise, might want
<br/>  Reason, and likelyhood, the firmest Base
<br/>  And made of Miracle, now faith is scant,
<br/>  Will vanish soone, and so possesse no place,
<br/>  And yow and itt, too, mvch grace might disgrace.
<br/>  When all (as truth commands assent) confesse
<br/>  All truth of yow, yett they will doubt, how I
<br/>  One corne of one lowe Ant-hills dust, and lesse
<br/>  Should name, knowe, or expresse, a thing so high
<br/>  And not an Inch measure Infinitie.
<br/>  I cannot tell them, nor my selfe, nor you;
<br/>  But leaue, least truth bee endangerd by my praise
<br/>  And turne to God who knowes I thinke this true,
<br/>  And vseth oft, when such a hart missaies,
<br/>  To make itt good: for such a prayser praies.
<br/>  Hee will best teach yow, how you should lay out
<br/>  His stocke of beautye, learning, fauour, blood,
<br/>  Hee will perplex securitie with doubt
<br/>  And cleere those doubts, hid from you, and showe you good,
<br/>  And so increase your appetite, and food.
<br/>  Hee will teach yow, that good, and bad haue not
<br/>  One latitude in Cloysters, and in Court;
<br/>  Indifferent there the greatest space hath gott;
<br/>  Some pitie is not good there: some vaine disport
<br/>  On this side Sinne, with that place may comport.
<br/>  Yett hee as hee bounds Seas, will fix your howres
<br/>  Which pleasure, and delight may not ingresse
<br/>  And though what none els lost, bee truliest yours,
<br/>  Hee will make yow, what yow did not possesse
<br/>  By vsinge others, not Vice but weakenes.
<br/>  Hee will make yow speak truths, and credibly,
<br/>  And make you doubt that others doe not so;
<br/>  Hee will prouide you keys, and Locks, to spy,
<br/>  And scape Spies, to good ends: And hee will showe
<br/>  What yow may not acknowledge, what not know.
<br/>  For your owne Conscience, hee giues Innocence,
<br/>  But for your Fame a discreet warines;
<br/>  And though to scape, then to revenge offence
<br/>  Bee better, hee shewes both: And to represse
<br/>  Ioy, when your state swells, sadnesse when tis lesse.
<br/>  From neede of teares, hee will defend your Soule,
<br/>  Or make A Re-baptisinge of one teare,
<br/>  Hee cannott, thats hee will nott disenrowle
<br/>  Your Name: and when with Actiue Ioye wee heere
<br/>  This Priuate Gospell, then tis our new Yeare.
