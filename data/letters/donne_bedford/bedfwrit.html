<h3> To the Countesse of B </h3>

<br/>  To haue written then, when yow writt, seemd to mee
<br/>  Worst of Spirituall vices, Simonee.
<br/>  And not to haue written then seemes littell lesse,
<br/>  The worst of civill vices, Thankelesnes.
<br/>  In this my debt, I seemd loth to confesse;
<br/>  In that I seemd to shun Beholdingnesse.
<br/>  But tis not so: Nothings, as I am, may
<br/>  Pay all they haue, and yett haue all to paie.
<br/>  Such borrow in ther Paments, and owe more
<br/>  By havinge leaue to write so, then before.
<br/>  Yett since rich Mines in barren grownds are showne
<br/>  May not I yeild (not Gold) but Cole, or Stone?
<br/>  Temples were not demolished, though profane;
<br/>  Here Peter, Ioues, there Paul hath Dians Fane;
<br/>  So whether my Hymns yow admitt or chuse,
<br/>  In mee you haue hallowed a Pagan Muse,
<br/>  And Denizend a stranger: who mistought
<br/>  By blamers of the tymes they mard, hath sought
<br/>  Vertues in Corners, which now brauely doe
<br/>  Shine in the Worlds best parts, or all itt, You.
<br/>  I haue bene tould, that Vertue in Courtiers hartes
<br/>  Suffers an Ostracisme, and departes:
<br/>  Proffitt, Ease, fittness, Plentie bid itt goe;
<br/>  But whither, only knowinge you, I knowe.
<br/>  Your, or you, Vertue, two vast vses serues,
<br/>  It ransomes One sexe and One Court preserues.
<br/>  Theres Nothing but your worth, which beinge true
<br/>  Is knowne to any other not to yow.
<br/>  And yow can never know itt; to admitt
<br/>  No knowledg of your worth, is some of itt.
<br/>  But since to yow your prayses discordes bee,
<br/>  Stoope, others ills to meditate with mee.
<br/>  Oh to confesse wee knowe not what wee should,
<br/>  Is halfe excuse, wee know not what wee would.
<br/>  Lightness depresses vs; Emptines fills;
<br/>  Wee sweate, and faint, yet still goe downe the Hills.
<br/>  As new Philosophie arrests the Sunne,
<br/>  And bids the passiue Earth about itt rvnne
<br/>  So wee haue duld our mynde: It hath no ends;
<br/>  Only the body is busie, and pretends.
<br/>  As dead low Earth Eclipses and controules
<br/>  The quick high Moone; so doth the body Soules.
<br/>  In none but vs are such mixt Engines found
<br/>  As hands of double office; for the ground
<br/>  Wee till with them, and them to heauen wee raise.
<br/>  Who Praier-lesse labours, or with out this prayes
<br/>  Doth but one halfe; thats none. Hee which said Plough
<br/>  And looke not back, to looke vp, doth allow.
<br/>  Good seede degenerates, and oft obaies
<br/>  The Soyles disease, and into Cockle straies.
<br/>  Lett the Myndes thoughts bee but transplanted so
<br/>  Into the body, and Basterdly they growe.
<br/>  What hate could hurt our bodies like our loue?
<br/>  Wee, but no forreine tyrans, could remoue
<br/>  These not ingraued, but inborne Dignities,
<br/>  Casketts of Soules, Temples, and Pallaces;
<br/>  For bodies shall from death redeemed bee
<br/>  Soules but preserud, not naturallie free;
<br/>  As Men to our Prisons now, Soules to vs are sent,
<br/>  Which learne itt there, and come in Innocent.
<br/>  First seedes of every Creature are in Vs;
<br/>  What ere the world hath bad, or pretious,
<br/>  Mans bodie can produce; hence hath itt bene
<br/>  That Stones, Wormes, froggs, and snakes in Man are seene
<br/>  But who ere saw, though Nature can worke so,
<br/>  That Pearle, or Gold, or Corne in Man did growe?
<br/>  Wee haue added to the world Virginia, and sent
<br/>  Two new Starrs lately to the Firmament.
<br/>  Why grudge wee vs, not heaven the dignitie
<br/>  To increase with ours, those faire Soules Companie?
<br/>  But I mvst end this letter: Though it doe
<br/>  Stand on two truthes, neither is true to yow;
<br/>  Vertue hath some perversnes; for shee will
<br/>  Neither beleeue her good, nor others ill.
<br/>  Even in yow, Vertues best Paradise,
<br/>  Vertue hath some, but wise degrees of Vice.
<br/>  Too manie vertues, or too mvch of one
<br/>  Begetts in yow vniust Suspition;
<br/>  And ignorance of Vice Makes Vertue lesse,
<br/>  Quenchinge Compassion of our wretchednesse.
<br/>  But these are Riddles: Some aspertion
<br/>  Of vice becomes well some Complexion.
<br/>  Statesmen purge vice with Vice, and may Corrode
<br/>  The bad with bad, a Spider with A Toad.
<br/>  For so ill thralls not them, but they tame ill,
<br/>  And make her doe mvch good against her will:
<br/>  But in your Commonwealth, or world in yow,
<br/>  Vice hath no office, nor good worke to doe.
<br/>  Take then no vitious Purge, but bee content
<br/>  With Cordiall Vertue, your knowne nourishment.
