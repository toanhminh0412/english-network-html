<strong>To Mr. B. B.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Is not thy sacred hunger of science<br/>
Yet satisfied? Is not thy braines rich hive<br/>
Fullfilld with hony which thou dost derive<br/>
From the Arts Spiritts and ther Quintessence?<br/>
Then weane thy selfe at last, and thee withdraw 5<br/>
From Cambrige thy old Nource, and as the rest<br/>
Here toughly chaw, and sturdily disgest<br/>
Th’immense vast Volumes of our Common Law.<br/>
And begin soone, least my griefe grieve thee to.<br/>
Which is that that which I should haue begonne 10<br/>
In my youths Morning, now late must be donne.<br/>
And I, as giddy trauailers, must do<br/>
Which stray or sleepe all day, and hauing lost<br/>
Light and strength; dark and tyr’d must then ride post.<br/>
If thou vnto thy Muse be maried 15<br/>
Embrace her still: encrease and multiply;<br/>
Be farr from me that strange adultery<br/>
To tempt thee and procure her Widowhed.<br/>
My Muse (for I had one) because I ame cold<br/>
Deuorc’d her selfe: the cause beeing in mee 20<br/>
That I can take no new in bigamee<br/>
Not my will only but power doth withhold.<br/>
Hence comes it that these rimes which never had<br/>
Mother, want matter; and they only haue<br/>
A litle forme the which ther father gaue; 25<br/>
They are prophane, imperfect, Oh too bad<br/>
To be counted Children of Poetree<br/>
Except confirmd and bishopped by thee.<br/>
