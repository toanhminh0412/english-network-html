<strong>To The Honorable Lady Carew</strong>
<br/>
Madame,
<br/>
<br/>
Here, where by all, all Saints invoked are,<br/>
T’were too much Scisme to bee singulare,<br/>
And gainst a practise generall to war;<br/>
Yett, turninge to Saints, should my’Humilitee<br/>
To other Saint, then yow, directed bee, 5<br/>
That were to make my Scisme Heresee.<br/>
Nor would I bee a Convertite so cold<br/>
As not to tell ytt; If thys bee to bold,<br/>
Pardons are in thys Market cheaply sold.<br/>
Where, because Fayth ys in too lowe degree, 10<br/>
I thought yt some Apostleship in mee,<br/>
To speak things which by Fayth alone I see:<br/>
That ys, of yow; who are a firmament<br/>
Of vertues, where no one ys growen, nor spent;<br/>
Thay’are your Materialls, not your Ornament. 15<br/>
Others, whom wee call vertuous, are not so<br/>
In theyr whole Substance, but theyr vertues grow<br/>
But in theyr Humors, and at Seasons show.<br/>
For when through tastles flatt Humilitee,<br/>
In Doe-bakd men, some Harmelesnes wee see, 20<br/>
Tis but hys Flegme that’s vertuous, and not hee.<br/>
So ys the Blood sometymes; who euer ran<br/>
To Danger vnimportund, hee was than<br/>
No better then a Sanguine vertuous man.<br/>
386  Texts and Apparatuses<br/>
So Cloystrall Men who in pretence of fear, 25<br/>
All Contributions to thys Lyfe forbear,<br/>
Haue vertu in Melancholy, and onely there.<br/>
Spirituall Cholerique Critiqs, which in all<br/>
Religions, find faults, and forgiue no fall,<br/>
Haue, through thys Zeale, vertu, but in theyr Gall. 30<br/>
We’are thus but parcell-gilt; To Gold we’are growen,<br/>
When vertu ys our Soules Complexione;<br/>
Who knowes hys vertues Name, or Place, hath none.<br/>
Vertu ys but Aguishe, when tis Seuerall;<br/>
By’Occasion wak’d, and Circumstantiall; 35<br/>
True vertu ys Soule, allways in all deeds all.<br/>
Thys vertu, thinkinge to giue Dignitee<br/>
To your Soule, found there no infirmitee;<br/>
For your Soule was as good vertu as shee.<br/>
Shee therfore wrought upon that part of yow, 40<br/>
Which ys scarse lesse then Soule, as shee could doe,<br/>
And soe hath made your Beauty vertue too;<br/>
Hence comes yt, that your Beauty wounds not harts<br/>
As others, with prophane and Sensuall darts,<br/>
But, as an Influence, vertuous thoughts imparts. 45<br/>
But if such frinds, by the’honor of your Sight<br/>
Grow capable of thys so great a light,<br/>
As to partake your vertues, and theyr might,<br/>
What must I thinke that Influence must doe,<br/>
Where yt finds Simpathy, and Matter too, 50<br/>
Vertu, and Beauty, of the same stuffe, as yow:<br/>
Which ys, your noble worthy Sister; Shee,<br/>
Of whom, if what in thys my extasye,<br/>
And Reuelation of yow both, I see,<br/>
I should write here, As in short Galleryes 55<br/>
The Master at the end large glasses tyes,<br/>
So to present the roome twice to our eyes,<br/>

So I should giue thys letter length, and say<br/>
That which I sayd of yow; There ys no way<br/>
From eyther, but by th’other, not to stray. 60
<br/>May therfore thys bee’inough to testify
<br/>My true Deuotion, free from flattery.
<br/>He that beleeus himselfe, doth never ly.
