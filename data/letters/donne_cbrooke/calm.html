        <strong>The Calme</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/> Our storm is past, and that storm's tyrannous rage,
        <br/>A stupid calm, but nothing it, doth 'suage.
        <br/>The fable is inverted, and far more
        <br/>A block afflicts, now, than a stork before.
        <br/>Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or us;
        <br/>In calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus.
        <br/>As steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were,
        <br/>Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there,
        <br/>The sea is now; and, as the isles which we
        <br/>Seek, when we can move, our ships rooted be.
        <br/>As water did in storms, now pitch runs out;
        <br/>As lead, when a fir'd church becomes one spout.
        <br/>And all our beauty, and our trim, decays,
        <br/>Like courts removing, or like ended plays.
        <br/>The fighting-place now seamen's rags supply;
        <br/>And all the tackling is a frippery.
        <br/>No use of lanthorns; and in one place lay
        <br/>Feathers and dust, to-day and yesterday.
        <br/>Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are,
        <br/>Have no more wind than the upper vault of air.
        <br/>We can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover,
        <br/>But meteor-like, save that we move not, hover.
        <br/>Only the calenture together draws
        <br/>Dear friends, which meet dead in great fishes' jaws;
        <br/>And on the hatches, as on altars, lies
        <br/>Each one, his own priest, and own sacrifice.
        <br/>Who live, that miracle do multiply,
        <br/>Where walkers in hot ovens do not die.
        <br/>If in despite of these we swim, that hath
        <br/>No more refreshing than our brimstone bath;
        <br/>But from the sea into the ship we turn,
        <br/>Like parboil'd wretches, on the coals to burn.
        <br/>Like Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' scoff,
        <br/>Or like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair off,
        <br/>Languish our ships. Now as a myriad
        <br/>Of ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake invade,
        <br/>The crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny chips,
        <br/>Might brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid ships.
        <br/>Whether a rotten state, and hope of gain,
        <br/>Or to disuse me from the queasy pain
        <br/>Of being belov'd and loving, or the thirst
        <br/>Of honour, or fair death, out-push'd me first,
        <br/>I lose my end; for here, as well as I,
        <br/>A desperate may live, and a coward die.
        <br/>Stag, dog, and all which from or towards flies,
        <br/>Is paid with life or prey, or doing dies.
        <br/>Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay
        <br/>A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray.
        <br/>He that at sea prays for more wind, as well
        <br/>Under the poles may beg cold, heat in hell.
        <br/>What are we then? How little more, alas,
        <br/>Is man now, than before he was? He was
        <br/>Nothing; for us, we are for nothing fit;
        <br/>Chance, or ourselves, still disproportion it.
        <br/>We have no power, no will, no sense; I lie,
        <br/>I should not then thus feel this misery. <br/><br/>
