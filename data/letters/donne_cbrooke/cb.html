        <strong>To Mr. C. B.</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/> Thy frind whom thy deserts to thee enchaine,
        <br/>   Vrgâ€™d by this inexcusable occasion,
        <br/>   Thee and the saint of his affection
        <br/> Leaving behind, doth of both wantes complaine.
        <br/> And lett the love I beare to both sustaine  5
        <br/>   No blott nor maime by this division;
        <br/>   Strong is this love which tyes our hartes in one
        <br/> And strong that love pursued with amorous paine.
        <br/> And though besides thy selfe I leave behind
        <br/>   Heavens liberall and earths thrice fairer Sonne,   10
        <br/>   Going to where sterne winter ay doth wonne,
        <br/> Yet loves hot fires which martire my sad minde
        <br/>   Do send forth scalding sighs, which have the Art
        <br/>   To melte all Ice but that which walles her hart. <br/><br/>
