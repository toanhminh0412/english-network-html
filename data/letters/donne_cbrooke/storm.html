<strong>The Storm</strong>
<br />
<br />Thou which art I, ('tis nothing to be so)
<br />Thou which art still thyself, by these shalt know
<br />Part of our passage; and, a hand, or eye
<br />By Hilliard drawn, is worth an history,
<br />By a worse painter made; and (without pride)
<br />When by thy judgement they are dignified,
<br />My lines are such: 'tis the pre-eminence
<br />Of friendship only to impute excellence.
<br />England to whom we owe, what we be, and have,
<br />Sad that her sons did seek a foreign grave
<br />(For, Fate's, or Fortune's drifts none can soothsay,
<br />Honour and misery have one face and way)
<br />From out her pregnant entrails sighed a wind
<br />Which at th' air's middle marble room did find
<br />Such strong resistance, that itself it threw
<br />Downward again; and so when it did view
<br />How in the port, our fleet dear time did leese,
<br />Withering like prisoners, which lie but for fees,
<br />Mildly it kissed our sails, and, fresh and sweet,
<br />As to a stomach starved, whose insides meet,
<br />Meat comes, it came; and swole our sails, when we
<br />So joyed, as Sara her swelling joyed to see.
<br />But 'twas but so kind, as our countrymen,
<br />Which bring friends one day's way, and leave them then.
<br />Then like two mighty kings, which dwelling far
<br />Asunder, meet against a third to war,
<br />The south and west winds joined, and, as they blew,
<br />Waves like a rolling trench before them threw.
<br />Sooner than you read this line, did the gale,
<br />Like shot, not feared till felt, our sails assail;
<br />And what at first was called a gust, the same
<br />Hath now a storm's, anon a tempest's name.
<br />Jonas, I pity thee, and curse those men,
<br />Who when the storm raged most, did wake thee then;
<br />Sleep is pain's easiest salve, and doth fulfil
<br />All offices of death, except to kill.
<br />But when I waked, I saw, that I saw not.
<br />I, and the sun, which should teach me had forgot
<br />East, west, day, night, and I could only say,
<br />If the world had lasted, now it had been day.
<br />Thousands our noises were, yet we 'mongst all
<br />Could none by his right name, but thunder call:
<br />Lightning was all our light, and it rained more
<br />Than if the sun had drunk the sea before.
<br />Some coffined in their cabins lie, equally
<br />Grieved that they are not dead, and yet must die.
<br />And as sin-burdened souls from graves will creep,
<br />At the last day, some forth their cabins peep:
<br />And tremblingly ask what news, and do hear so,
<br />Like jealous husbands, what they would not know.
<br />Some sitting on the hatches, would seem there,
<br />With hideous gazing to fear away fear.
<br />Then note they the ship's sicknesses, the mast
<br />Shaked with this ague, and the hold and waist
<br />With a salt dropsy clogged, and all our tacklings
<br />Snapping, like too high stretched treble strings.
<br />And from our tottered sails, rags drop down so,
<br />As from one hanged in chains, a year ago.
<br />Even our ordnance placed for our defence,
<br />Strive to break loose, and 'scape away from thence.
<br />Pumping hath tired our men, and what's the gain?
<br />Seas into seas thrown, we suck in again;
<br />Hearing hath deafed our sailors; and if they
<br />Knew how to hear, there's none knows what to say.
<br />Compared to these storms, death is but a qualm,
<br />Hell somewhat lightsome, and the Bermuda calm.
<br />Darkness, light's elder brother, his birth-right
<br />Claims o'er this world, and to heaven hath chased light.
<br />All things are one, and that one none can be,
<br />Since all forms, uniform deformity
<br />Doth cover, so that we, except God say
<br />Another Fiat , shall have no more day.
<br />So violent, yet long these furies be,
<br />That though thine absence starve me, I wish not thee.
