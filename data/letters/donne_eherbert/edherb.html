<strong> To Sir Ed:. Herbert at Iulyers </strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Man is a lumpe, where all Beasts kneaded bee;
<br/>  Wisedome makes hym an Arke where all agree.
<br/>  The foole in whom these beasts doe liue at iarre,
<br/>  Is sport to others, and a Theater.
<br/>  Nor scapes he soe, but is himselfe theyre Pray.
<br/>  All which was man in him, ys eate away;
<br/>  And nowe his beasts on One another feede,
<br/>  Yet coople in Anger, and new Monsters breede.
<br/>  Howe happye is hee which hath due Place assign'd
<br/>  To his Beasts, and disaforested his Mynde?
<br/>  Empayld hymselfe, to keepe them out, not in,
<br/>  Can sowe, and dares trust corne, where they haue beene,
<br/>  Can vse his horse, Goate, wolfe, and everye beast,
<br/>  And ys not asse hymselfe to all the rest?
<br/>  Else, man not Only is the heard of swine,
<br/>  But he is those Devills too, which did inclyne
<br/>  Them to a headlong rage, and made them worse.
<br/>  For man can add wayte to heauens heauiest Curse.
<br/>  As soules (they say) by our first touch, take in
<br/>  The Poysonous tincture of Originall Sin,
<br/>  Soe to the punnishments which God doth flynge
<br/>  Our Apprehension contributes the stinge.
<br/>  To vs, as to his Chickens, he doth cast
<br/>  Hemlocke, and wee, as men, his Hemlocke tast.
<br/>  Wee doe infuse, to what he ment for meate,
<br/>  Corrosiuenes, or intens Cold, or heate.
<br/>  For God noe such specifique poyson hath,
<br/>  As kills, wee knowe not howe; His fiercest wrath
<br/>  Hath noe Antipathye; But may bee Good,
<br/>  At least for Physicke, if not for our foode.
<br/>  Thus Man that might be his Pleasure, is his Rod;
<br/>  And ys his Devill, that might be his God.
<br/>  Since then our busines ys to rectifye
<br/>  Nature, to what she was, we are led awry,
<br/>  By them, who Man to vs, in litle showe;
<br/>  Greater then due, noe forme we can bestowe
<br/>  On him: for man into himselfe can drawe
<br/>  All: All his Faith can swallowe, or Reason chawe.
<br/>  All that is fill'd, and all that which doth fill,
<br/>  All the round world, to man is but a pill.
<br/>  In all yt workes not, but it is in all
<br/>  Poysonous, or Purgatiue, or Cordyall.
<br/>  For knowledge kindles Calentures in some
<br/>  And is to others Icy Opium.
<br/>  As braue, as true, ys that profession than,
<br/>  Which you doe vse to make;  That you knowe man.
<br/>  Thys makes yt Credible; you haue dwelt vpon
<br/>  All worthy Bookes, and now are such a one.
<br/>  Actions are Authors; And of those in you,
<br/>  Your freindes fynde everye day a Mart of new.
