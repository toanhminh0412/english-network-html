<strong> To Sr Henry Goodyere </strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Who makes the Past, a Patterne for next yeare
<br/>  Turnes no new leafe, but still the same thinges reades,
<br/>  Seene thinges he sees agayne, heard thinges doth heare
<br/>  And makes hys life, but like a payre of beades.
<br/>  A Pallace, when tis that, which yt shold bee
<br/>  Leaues groweing, and stands such, or else decayes,
<br/>  But he which dwells there, is not soe; for hee
<br/>  Striues to vrdge vpward, and hys fortune rayse.
<br/>  So had your Body her morning, hath her Noone,
<br/>  And shall not better, her next change is Night,
<br/>  But her fayre lardger Guest, to whom Sunne and Moone
<br/>  Are Sparkes, and short-liued, claymes another right.
<br/>  The Noble Soule by Age growes lustyer,
<br/>  Her appetite, and her digestion mend,
<br/>  Wee must not sterve, nor hope to pamper her
<br/>  With woemens milke, and papp vnto the End.
<br/>  Provide you Manlyer Dyett, you haue seene
<br/>  All Libraryes, which are Schooles, Camps, and Courts.
<br/>  But aske your Garners, if you haue not bin
<br/>  In haruests, too indulgent to your Sports.
<br/>  Wold you redeeme yt?  then yourselfe transplant
<br/>  Awhyle from hence, perchance outlandish ground
<br/>  Beares not more witt, then Ours, but yett more skant
<br/>  Are those Diuersions there, which here abound.
<br/>  To be a Strainger, hath that benifitt,
<br/>  Wee can beginnings, but not habitts choake;
<br/>  Goe, whither? hence; You gett, if you forgett,
<br/>  New falts, till they prescribe in Vs, are Smoake.
<br/>  Our Soule, whose Country is Heauen, and God her father
<br/>  Into thys world, Corruptions Sincke, is sent,
<br/>  Yett so much in her trauayle she doth gather
<br/>  That She retornes home wiser then she went.
<br/>  It payes you well, yf it teach you to spare,
<br/>  And make you asham'd, to make your haukes prayse yours,
<br/>  Which, when herselfe she lessens in the Ayre
<br/>  You then first say, that high enough she toures.
<br/>  Howsoeuer keepe the liuely tast, you hold
<br/>  Of God, loue him as now, but feare him more,
<br/>  And in your Afternoones, thincke what you told
<br/>  And promisd him, at morning Prayer before.
<br/>  Lett Falshood like a Discord anger you,
<br/>  Else be not froward; But why doe I touch
<br/>  Thinges of which none ys in your Practise newe.
<br/>  And Fables, or fruite trenchers teach as much.
<br/>  But thus I make you keepe your Promise, Sir,
<br/>  Riding I had you, though you still stayd there,
<br/>  And in these thoughts, allthough you neuer stirre
<br/>  You came with mee to Micham, and are here.
