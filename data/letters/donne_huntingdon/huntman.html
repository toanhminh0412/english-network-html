<strong>To the Countesse of Huntingdon</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Man to Gods Image, Eve to mans was made
<br/>  Nor find wee that god breathd a soule in her;
<br/>  Cannons will not Church functions you invade
<br/>  Nor Lawes to Ciuill office you preferre.
<br/>  Who vagrant transitory Comets sees
<br/>  Wonders because th'are rare. But a new starre
<br/>  Whose motion with the firmament agrees
<br/>  Is Miracle, for there no new things are.
<br/>  In woman so, perchance, mild Innocence
<br/>  A seldome Comet is, but Actiue good
<br/>  A Miracle which Reason scapes and sence
<br/>  For Art and Nature this in them withstood.
<br/>  As such a starre the Magis lead to view
<br/>  The Manger-cradled Infant, God below
<br/>  By vertues beames (by fame deriud from you)
<br/>  May apt soules, and the worst may vertue knowe.
<br/>  If the worlds Age and death bee argued well
<br/>  By the Sunns fall, which now towards Earth doth bend,
<br/>  Then wee might feare that Vertue, since shee fell
<br/>  So low as woman, should bee neere her end.
<br/>  But shee's not stoop'd but raysd, Exil'd by men,
<br/>  Shee fledd to heauen, that's heauenly things, that's you,
<br/>  Shee was on all men thinly scatterd then
<br/>  But now a masse contracted in a few.
<br/>  Shee guilded vs, but you are Gold, and shee
<br/>  Informed vs, but transubstantiats you.
<br/>  Soft dispositions which ductile bee
<br/>  Elixar-like shee makes, not cleane but new.
<br/>  Though you a wiues and mothers name retayne,
<br/>  Tis not as Woman (for all are not so)
<br/>  But vertue, hauing made you vertue, is fayne
<br/>  To adhere on those names, Her and you to showe;
<br/>  Else, beeing alike pure, wee should neyther see,
<br/>  As Water, beeing into Ayre rarifyd,
<br/>  Neyther appeeres till in one cloud they bee:
<br/>  So, for our sakes you doe lowe names abide.
<br/>  Taught by greate Constellations (which, beeing framd
<br/>  Of the most starrs, take lowe names, Crabb and Bull,
<br/>  When single Planets by the Gods ar nam'd)
<br/>  You couet not greate names (of greate things full)
<br/>  So you, as woman, one doth comprehend
<br/>  And, in the vayle of kindred, others see.
<br/>  To some you are reveald, as in a frind,
<br/>  And, as a vertuous Prince, far off, to mee.
<br/>  To whome (because from you all Vertues flow
<br/>  And tis not none to dare contemplate you)
<br/>  I which doe so, as your true subiect, owe
<br/>  Some tribute for that, So these lines ar due.
<br/>  If you can thinke these flatteryes, they are
<br/>  For then your Iudgement is below my prayse.
<br/>  If they were so, oft, flatteryes worke as farr
<br/>  As Counsells, and as farr th'Endeuor rayse.
<br/>  So my ill reaching you might there growe good
<br/>  (But I remayne a poysond fountayne still)
<br/>  But not your Vertue, Beauty, knowledge, Bloud
<br/>  Far more aboue all flatteryes then my will.
<br/>  And if I flatter any, tis not you
<br/>  But mine owne Iudgement, who did long agoe
<br/>  Pronounce that all these prayses should bee true
<br/>  And Vertue should your Beauty and Birth outgrow.
<br/>  Now that my Prophesyes are all fulfilld
<br/>  Rather then God should not bee honord too
<br/>  And all those gifts confessd which hee instilld
<br/>  Your selfe were bound to say that which I doe;
<br/>  So I but your Recorder am in this
<br/>  Or mouth and spender of the vniuerse,
<br/>  A ministeriall notary.  For tis
<br/>  Not I, but You and fame that make this verse;
<br/>  I was your Prophet in your younger dayes
<br/>  And now your Chaplayne God in you to prayse.
