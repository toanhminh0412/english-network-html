<strong>To the Countesse of Huntingdon</strong>
<br/>
<br/> That unripe side of earth, that heavy clime
<br/> That gives us man up now, like %1Adams%2 time
<br/> Before he ate; mans shape, that would yet bee
<br/> (Knew they not it, and fear'd beasts companie)
<br/> So naked at this day, as though man there
<br/> From Paradise so great a distance were,
<br/> As yet the newes could not arrived bee
<br/> Of %1Adams%2 tasting the forbidden tree;
<br/> Depriv'd of that free state which they were in,
<br/> And wanting the reward, yet beare the sinne.
<br/> But, as from extreme hights who downward looks,
<br/> Sees men at childrens shapes, Rivers at brookes,
<br/> And loseth younger formes; so, to your eye,
<br/> These (Madame) that without your distance lie,
<br/> Must either mist, or nothing seeme to be,
<br/> Who are at home but wits mere %1Atomi%2.
<br/> But, I who can behold them move, and stay,
<br/> Have found my selfe to you, just their midway;
<br/> And now must pitty them; for, as they doe
<br/> Seeme sick to me, just so must I to you,
<br/> Yet neither will I vexe your eyes to see
<br/> A sighing Ode, nor crosse-arm'd Elegie.
<br/> I come not to call pitty from your heart,
<br/> Like some white-liver'd dotard that would part
<br/> Else from his slipperie soule with a faint groane,
<br/> And faithfully, (without you smil'd) were gone.
<br/> I cannot feele the tempest of a frowne,
<br/> I may be rais'd by love, but not throwne down.
<br/> Though I can pittie those sigh twice a day,
<br/> I hate that thing whispers it selfe away.
<br/> Yet since all love is fever, who to trees
<br/> Doth talke, doth yet in loves cold ague freeze.
<br/> 'Tis love, but, with such fatall weaknesse made,
<br/> That it destroyes it selfe with its owne shade.
<br/> Who first look'd sad, griev'd, pin'd, and shew'd his paine,
<br/> Was he that first taught women, to disdaine.
<br/> As all things were one nothing, dull and weake,
<br/> Vntill this raw disordered heape did breake,
<br/> And severall desires led parts away,
<br/> Water declin'd with earth, the ayre did stay,
<br/> Fire rose, and each from other but unty'd,
<br/> Themselves unprison'd were and purify'd:
<br/> So was love, first in vast confusion hid,
<br/> An unripe willingnesse which nothing did,
<br/> A thirst, an Appetite which had no ease,
<br/> That found a want, but knew not what would please.
<br/> What pretty innocence in those dayes mov'd?
<br/> Man ignorantly walk'd by her he lov'd;
<br/> Both sigh'd and enterchang'd a speaking eye,
<br/> Both trembled and were sick, both knew not why.
<br/> That naturall fearefulnesse that struck man dumbe,
<br/> Might well (those times considered) man become.
<br/> As all discoverers whose first assay
<br/> Findes but the place, after, the nearest way:
<br/> So passion is to womans love, about,
<br/> Nay, farther off, than when we first set out.
<br/> It is not love that sueth, or doth contend;
<br/> Love either conquers, or but meets a friend.
<br/> Man's better part consists of purer fire,
<br/> And findes it selfe allow'd, ere it desire.
<br/> Love is wise here, keepes home, gives reason sway,
<br/> And journeys not till it finde summer-way.
<br/> A weather-beaten Lover but once knowne,
<br/> Is sport for every girle to practise on.
<br/> Who strives through womans scornes, women to know,
<br/> Is lost, and seekes his shadow to outgoe;
<br/> It must bee sicknesse after one disdaine,
<br/> Though he be call'd aloud, to looke againe.
<br/> Let others sigh, and grieve; one cunning sleight
<br/> Shall freeze my Love to Christall in a night.
<br/> I can love first, and (if I winne) love still;
<br/> And cannot be remov'd, unlesse she will.
<br/> It is her fault if I unsure remaine,
<br/> Shee onely can untie, I binde againe.
<br/> The honesties of love with ease I doe,
<br/> But am no porter for a tedious woe.
<br/> But (madame) I now thinke on you; and here
<br/> Where we are at our hights, you but appeare,
<br/> We are but clouds, you rise from our noone-ray,
<br/> But a foule shadow, not your breake of day.
<br/> You are at first hand all that's faire and right,
<br/> And others good reflects but backe your light.
<br/> You are a perfectnesse, so curious hit,
<br/> That youngest flatteries doe scandall it.
<br/> For, what is more doth what you are restraine,
<br/> And though beyond, is downe the hill againe.
<br/> We have no next way to you, we crosse to it:
<br/> You are the straight line, thing prais'd, attribute,
<br/> Each good in you's a light; so many a shade
<br/> You make, and in them are your motions made.
<br/> These are your pictures to the life. From farre
<br/> We see you move, and here your %1Zani's%2 are:
<br/> So that no fountaine good there is, doth grow
<br/> In you, but our dimme actions faintly shew.
<br/> Then finde I, if mans noblest part be love,
<br/> Your purest luster must that shadow move.
<br/> The soule with body, is a heaven combin'd
<br/> With earth, and for mans ease, but nearer joyn'd.
<br/> Where thoughts the starres of soule we understand,
<br/> We guesse not their large natures, but command.
<br/> And love in you, that bountie is of light,
<br/> That gives to all, and yet hath infinite.
<br/> Whose heat doth force us thither to intend,
<br/> But soule we finde too earthly to ascend,
<br/> 'Till slow accesse hath made it wholy pure,
<br/> Able immortall clearnesse to endure.
<br/> Who dare aspire this journey with a staine,
<br/> Hath waight will force him headlong backe againe.
<br/> No more can impure man retaine and move
<br/> In that pure region of a worthy love:
<br/> Then earthly substance can unforc'd aspire,
<br/> And leave his nature to converse with fire:
<br/> Such may have eye, and hand; may sigh, may speak;
<br/> But like swoln bubles, when they are high'st they break
<br/> Though far removed Northerne fleets scarce finde
<br/> The Sunnes comfort; others thinke him too kinde.
<br/> There is an equall distance from her eye,
<br/> Men perish too farre off, and burne too nigh.
<br/> Butje as ayre takes the Sunne-beames equall bright
<br/> From the first Rayes, to his last opposite:
<br/> So able man, blest with a vertuous Love,
<br/> Remote or neare, or howsoe'r they move;
<br/> There vertue breakes all clouds that might annoy,
<br/> There is no Emptinesse, but all is Ioy.
<br/> He much profanes whom violent heats doe move
<br/> To stile his wandring rage of passion, %1Love%2.
<br/> Love that imparts in every thing delight,
<br/> Is fancied
<br/> Why love among the vertues is not knowne
<br/> Is, that love is them all contracted one.
