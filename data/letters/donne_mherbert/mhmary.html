<strong>To the Lady Magdalen Herbert, of St. Mary Magdalen.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Her of your name, whose fair inheritance
<br/>  Bethina was, and jointure Magdalo:
<br/>  An active faith so highly did advance,
<br/>  That she once knew, more than the Church did know
<br/>  The Resurrection; so much good there is
<br/>  Deliver'd of her, that some Fathers be
<br/>  Loth to believe one Woman could do this;
<br/>  But, think these Magdalens were two or three.
<br/>  Increase their number, Lady, and their fame:
<br/>  To their Devotion, add your Innocence;
<br/>  Take so much of th'example, as of the name;
<br/>  The latter half; and in some recompence
<br/>  That they did harbour Christ himself, a Guest,
<br/>  Harbour these Hymns, to his dear name addrest.
