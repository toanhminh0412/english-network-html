<strong> To Lady Magdalen Herbert</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Mad paper stay and grudge not heere to burne
<br/>  With all those sonnes whom my braine did create,
<br/>  At least ly hid with me, till thou returne
<br/>  To rags againe, which was thy natiue state,
<br/>  What though thou haue enough unworthines
<br/>  To come unto great place as others doe,
<br/>  That's much, emboldens, puls, thrusts I confess,
<br/>  But that's not all, thou shouldst be wicked too.
<br/>  And that thou canst not learne, or not of me,
<br/>  Yet thou wilt goe! goe, since thou goest to her
<br/>  Who lackes but faultes to be a prince, for she
<br/>  Truth, whom they dare not pardon, dares prefer.
<br/>  But when thou com'st to that perplexing eye
<br/>  Which equally claimes loue and reuerence,
<br/>  Thou wilt not long dispute it, thou wilt dy,
<br/>  And hauing little now, haue then no sence.
<br/>  Yet when her warme redeeming hand, which is
<br/>  A miracle, and made such to worke more,
<br/>  Doth touch thee (saples leafe) thou growest by this
<br/>  Her creature glorified more then before.
<br/>  Then as a mother which delights to heare
<br/>  Her early child mispeake halfe uttered words
<br/>  Or because maiesty doth neuer feare
<br/>  Ill, or bould speech, she audience affoords.
<br/>  And then cold speechles wretch, thou di'st againe
<br/>  And wisely; what discourse is left for thee?
<br/>  From speech of ill, and her thou must abstaine
<br/>  and is there any good which is not she?
<br/>  Yet maist thou praise her seruants though not her
<br/>  And wit, and vertue, and honour her attend
<br/>  And since they are but her clothes, thou shalt not erre
<br/>  Yf thou her shape, and beauty, and grace commend.
<br/>  Who knowes thy destiny? when thou hast donne
<br/>  Perchance her cabinet may harbour thee
<br/>  Whither all noble ambitious wits doe runne,
<br/>  A nest almost as full of good as she.
<br/>  When thou art there yf any whom we know
<br/>  Were sau'd before, and did that heauen partake,
<br/>  When she revolv's his papers marke what show
<br/>  Of fauour she alone to them doth make.
<br/>  Marke yf to get to them she skip the rest,
<br/>  Marke yf she read them twice, or tear the name,
<br/>  Marke yf she do the same that they protest,
<br/>  Marke yf she marke whether her woman came.
<br/>  Marke yf slight thinges be obiected and oreblowen,
<br/>  Marke yf her oathes against him be not still
<br/>  Reserued, and that she grieues she's not her owne,
<br/>  And chides the doctrine that denies freewill.
<br/>  I bid thee not doe this to be my spy,
<br/>  Nor to make my selfe her familiar:
<br/>  But so much doe I loue her choice, that I
<br/>  Would faine loue him, that shall be lou'd of her.
