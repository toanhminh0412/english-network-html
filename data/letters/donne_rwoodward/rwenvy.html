<strong>To Mr. R. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Kindly I envy thy Songs perfection
<br/>  Built of all th'elements as our bodyes are:
<br/>  That litle of earth that'is in it, is a faire
<br/>  Delicious garden where all Sweetes are sowne.
<br/>  In it is cherishing fyer which dryes in mee
<br/>  Griefe which did drowne me: and halfe quench'd by it
<br/>  Are Satirique fyres which vrg'd me to have writt
<br/>  In skorne of all: for now I admyre thee.
<br/>  And as Ayre doth fullfill the hollownes
<br/>  Of rotten walls; so it myne emptines.
<br/>  Wher tost and movd it did begett this sound
<br/>  Which as a lame Eccho of thyne doth rebound.
<br/>  Oh I was dead: but since thy song new life did give
<br/>  I recreated even by thy Creature live.
