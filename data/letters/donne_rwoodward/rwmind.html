<br/>
<br/>  Muse not that by thy mind thy body'is led:
<br/>  For by thy mind, my mind'is distempered.
<br/>  So thy Care lives long for I bearing part
<br/>  It eates not onely thyne, but my swoln hart.
<br/>  And when it gives vs intermission
<br/>  We take new harts for it to feed vpon.
<br/>  But as a lay-mans Genius doth controule
<br/>  Body and mind; the Muse being the souls soule
<br/>  Of poets, that me thinks should ease our anguish,
<br/>  Although our bodyes wither and minds languish.
<br/>  Wright then, that my greifes which thyne got may bee
<br/>  Cur'd by thy charming soveraigne melodee.
