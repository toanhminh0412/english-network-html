<strong> To Mr. R. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  If as myne is thy life a slumber bee
<br/>  Seeme when thou readst these lines to dreame of mee:
<br/>  Neuer did Morpheus nor his brethren weare
<br/>  Shapes so like those shapes whom they would appeare
<br/>  As this my letter is like mee, for it
<br/>  Hath my name, words, hand, feete, hart, mind, and witt.
<br/>  It is my deede of guift, of mee to thee,
<br/>  It is my will, my selfe the legacee.
<br/>  So thy retyrings I love, yea envy,
<br/>  Bred in thee by a wise Melancholy
<br/>  That I reioyce, that vnto wher thou art
<br/>  Though I stay here, I can thus send my hart;
<br/>  As kindly as any inamored Patient
<br/>  His Picture to his absent love hath sent.
<br/>  All news I thinke sooner reach thee then mee;
<br/>  Hauens are heauens, and ships wing'd Angels bee
<br/>  The which both Gospell, and sterne threatnings bringe.
<br/>  Guyanaes haruest is nipt in the Springe
<br/>  I feare: And w%5th%6 vs (methinks) fate deales so
<br/>  As with the Iewes Guide, God did: He did show
<br/>  Him the riche land, but barr'd his entry in.
<br/>  Ah slownes is our punishment and sin.
<br/>  Perchance these Spanish busnesses beeing donne
<br/>  Which as the Earth betweene the Moone and Sonne
<br/>  Echps%>>Eclips< the light, which Guyana would giue
<br/>  Our discontinued hopes we shall retriue.
<br/>  But yf (as all th'All must) hopes smoke away
<br/>  Is not allmighty Vertu an India?
<br/>  If Men be Worlds, ther is in euery one
<br/>  Somthing to'answer in some proportione
<br/>  All the Worlds riches: and in good Men this
<br/>  Vertu our formes forme, and our Soules Soule is.
