<strong>To Mr. R. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Like one who'in her third widowhed doth profes
<br/>  Her selfe a Nun, tir'd to a retirednes
<br/>  So affects my Muse now a chast fallownes.
<br/>  Since She to few, yet to to many hath showne
<br/>  How Love song Weedes, and Satirique thornes are growne
<br/>  Where seedes of better arts weare early sowne.
<br/>  Though to vse and Love poetry, to mee
<br/>  Betroth'd to no one art be no adulteree,
<br/>  Omissions of good, ill, as ill deedes bee.
<br/>  For though to vs it seeme, and be light and thin,
<br/>  Yet in those faythfull Scales wher God throwes in
<br/>  Mens workes, Vanity wayes as much as Sin.
<br/>  If our Soules haue Staind their first whight, yet wee
<br/>  May clothe them with faythe and deare honestee,
<br/>  Which God imputes as native puritee.
<br/>  Ther is no Vertu but Religione.
<br/>  Wise, valiant, sober, iust, are names, which none
<br/>  Want, which want not Vice-covring discretione.
<br/>  Seeke we then our selues in our selues; for as
<br/>  Men force the Sun with much more force to pas
<br/>  By gathring his beams with a Christall glas,
<br/>  So we, if we into our selues will turne
<br/>  Blowing our Sparks of Vertu, may out-burne
<br/>  The Straw which doth about our harts soiorne.
<br/>  You know Phisitians when they would infuse
<br/>  Into'any Oyle the Soule of Simples, vse
<br/>  Places, wher they may ly still warme to chuse.
<br/>  So works retirednes in vs; to rome
<br/>  Giddily,'and be euery where but at home
<br/>  Such freedome doth a banishment become.
<br/>  We are but Farmers of our selues; yet may
<br/>  If we can stock our selues and thrive, vplay
<br/>  Much much dear treasure for the great rent day.
<br/>  Manure thy selfe then, to thy selfe be'approv'd,
<br/>  And with vayne outward things be no more mov'd,
<br/>  But to know that I love thee and would be lov'd.
