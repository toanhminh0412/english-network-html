<strong>To the Countesse of Salisbury</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Faire, Great, and Good, since seeing yow wee see
<br/>  What Heauen cann doe, what any earth cann bee,
<br/>  Since now your beautie shines, now when the Sun
<br/>  Growne stale is to so low a value rvnn,
<br/>  That his discheuled 'beames, and scattered fires,
<br/>  Serue but for Ladies Periwigs and tires
<br/>  In louers sonnets; yow come to repaire
<br/>  Gods booke of creatures, teaching what is faire.
<br/>  Since now when all is withered, shrunk, and dryed
<br/>  All vertue ebd out to a dead-low tide,
<br/>  All the worlds frame beinge crumbled into sand
<br/>  Where everie man thinks by him selfe to stand,
<br/>  Integritie, Frendship, and Confidence,
<br/>  (Cyments of Greatnes) being vapourd hence,
<br/>  And narrowe Mann being fild with littell shares.
<br/>  Court, City, Church are all shops of small wares
<br/>  All hauing blowne to sparks their noble fire
<br/>  And drawne their sound Gold Ingot into wire
<br/>  All tryinge by a loue of littlenes,
<br/>  To make Abridgements, and to drawe to lesse,
<br/>  Even that nothinge, which at first wee were.
<br/>  Since in thes tymes your greatness doth appeare
<br/>  And that wee learne by itt, that Man to gett
<br/>  Towards him thats Infinite, mvst first bee greate
<br/>  Since in an age soe ill, as none is fitt
<br/>  Soe mvch as to accuse, mvch less mend itt;
<br/>  (For who cann Iudge, or wittnes of thes tymes,
<br/>  Where all alike are guiltie of the Crimes)
<br/>  When hee that would bee good, is thought by all
<br/>  A Monster, or at least phantasticall.
<br/>  Since now yow durst bee good, and that I doe
<br/>  Discerne by daring to contemplate yow,
<br/>  That there may bee degrees of faire, Great, Good
<br/>  Through your light, largnes, vertue vnderstood.
<br/>  If in this sacrifice of myne, bee showne
<br/>  Any small spark of these, call it your owne
<br/>  And if things like these haue bin said by mee
<br/>  Of others, call not that Idolatrie.
<br/>  For had God made Mann first, and man had seene
<br/>  The third daies fruites, and flowers and various greene
<br/>  Hee might haue said the best that hee could saie
<br/>  Of those faire creatures, which were made that Daie
<br/>  And when next daie hee had admird the birth
<br/>  Of Sun, Moone, Starrs, fairer then late praisd Earth
<br/>  Hee might haue said, the best that hee could saie
<br/>  And not bee chid for praisinge Yesterdaie,
<br/>  Soe though some things are not together true
<br/>  As that another is worthyest, and that yow.
<br/>  Yet to saie soe doth not condemne a mann,
<br/>  If when hee spoke them, they ware both true than;
<br/>  How faire a proofe of this in our Soule growes?
<br/>  Wee first haue Soules of growth, and sense and those,
<br/>  When our last Soule, our Soule Immortall came,
<br/>  Were swallowed into itt, and haue no name,
<br/>  Nor doth hee iniure those Soules, which doth cast
<br/>  The power and praise of both them on the last;
<br/>  Noe more doe I wrong any: I adore
<br/>  The same things nowe, which I adord before,
<br/>  The subiect changd, and measure; the same thinge
<br/>  In a lowe Constable, and in the kynge
<br/>  I reverence: his power to worke on mee,
<br/>  Soe did I hvmblie reverence each degree
<br/>  Of faire, Greate, Good.  But more now I am come
<br/>  From hauing found their walkes, to finde their Home
<br/>  And as I owe my first Soules thanks, that they
<br/>  For my last Soule did fitt, and mould my claie;
<br/>  Soe am I debtor vnto them whose worthe
<br/>  Enabled mee to proffitt, and take forth
<br/>  This new great lesson, thus to studdie yow,
<br/>  Which none not readinge others first, could doe.
<br/>  Nor lack I light, to reede this booke, though I
<br/>  In a dark caue, yea in a Graue doe lye,
<br/>  For as your fellow Angells, soe yow doe
<br/>  Illustrate them, who come to studie yow.
<br/>  The first whome wee in Histories doe finde
<br/>  To haue professed all Arts was one borne blinde;
<br/>  Hee lackd those Eyes, Beasts haue as well as wee
<br/>  Not those by which Angells are seene, and see.
<br/>  Soe though I am borne, with out those Eyes to liue
<br/>  Which Fortune, who hath none her selfe doth giue
<br/>  Which are fitt meanes to see bright Courts, and yow,
<br/>  Yet may I see yow thus as now I doe,
<br/>  I shall by that all goodness haue discerned
<br/>  And though I burne my Librarye, bee learned.
