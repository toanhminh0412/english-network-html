<strong>To Mr Tilman after hee had taken Orders.</strong>
<br/>
<br/> Thou whose diuiner Soule hath caus'd thee now
<br/> To put thy hand vnto the holy plough
<br/> Making lay scornings of the ministry
<br/> Not an Impediment but victory
<br/> What bringst thou home with thee? how is thy mind
<br/> Affected in the vintage? dost thou find
<br/> New thoughts and stirringe in thee, and, as steele
<br/> Touchd with a Loadstone, dost new motions feele?
<br/> Or as a shipp after much payne and care
<br/> For Iron and Cloth bringst home rich Indian ware
<br/> Hast thou thus trafiqud, but with farre more gayne
<br/> Of noble goods and with lesse time and payne?
<br/> Art thou the same Materialls as before
<br/> Onely the stamp is changed, but no more?
<br/> And as new crowned kings alter the face
<br/> But not the monnyes substance, so hath Grace
<br/> Changd only gods old Image by creation
<br/> To Christs new stamp at this thy Coronation?
<br/> Or as wee paynt Angels with wings, because
<br/> They beare Gods Message and proclayme his Lawes
<br/> Since thou must doe the like, and, so, must moue
<br/> Art thou new featherd with celestiall loue?
<br/> Deare tell mee where thy purchase lyes, and showe
<br/> What thy aduantage is, aboue, below;
<br/> But if thy gayning doe surmount expression
<br/> Why doth the foolish world scorne that profession
<br/> Whose Ioyes passe speech? Why doe they think't vnfitt
<br/> That Gentry should ioyne familys with it?
<br/> Would they thinke it well if the day were spent
<br/> In dressing, mistressing, and Complement?
<br/> Alas, poore Ioyes, but poorer men, whose trust
<br/> Seemes richly placed in refined dust.
<br/> For such are clothes and beautyes, which, though gay
<br/> Ar at the best but as sublimed clay.
<br/> Let then the world thy calling disrespect
<br/> But goe thou on, and pitty theyr neglect.
<br/> What function is so noble, as to bee
<br/> Embassador to God and Destiny,
<br/> To open life, and giue kingdomes to more
<br/> Then kings giue dignityes, to keepe heauens dore?
<br/> Maryes Prerogatiue was to beare Christ, so
<br/> Tis preachers to conuey him (for they doe
<br/> As angels out of Clouds from pulpits speake
<br/> And blesse the poore beneath, the lame, the weake).
<br/> If then th'Astronomers, whereas they spie
<br/> A new found starre, theyr opticks magnify,
<br/> How braue are those, who with theyr Engines can
<br/> Bring Man to Heauen and Heauen to man?
<br/> These are thy titles and preheminences
<br/> In whome must meete Gods Graces, Mens offences.
<br/> And so, the heauens which beget all things heere
<br/> And th'earth our Mother which doth those things beare,
<br/> Both these in thee ar in thy calling knitt
<br/> And make thee now a blest Hermaphrodite.
