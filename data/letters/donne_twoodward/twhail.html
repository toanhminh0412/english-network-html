<strong>To Mr. T. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  All haile sweete Poet, more full of more strong fyre
<br/>  Then hath or shall enkindle any Spiritt.
<br/>  I lovd what Nature gaue thee, but this meritt
<br/>  Of witt and art I love not, but admyre.
<br/>  Who haue before, or shall write after thee,
<br/>  Ther works, though toughly Laboured, wilbee
<br/>  Like infancy or Age, to Mans firme stay,
<br/>  Or early and late twilights to Midday.
<br/>  Men say, and truly, that they better bee
<br/>  Which be envied then pitied, therfore I
<br/>  Because I wish thee best, do thee envy,
<br/>  Oh wouldst thou by like reason pity mee.
<br/>  But care not for mee: I that euer was
<br/>  In natures and in fortunes guifts alas
<br/>  Before thy grace got in the Muses schoole
<br/>  A Monster and a begger, am now a foole.
<br/>  Oh how I grieue that lateborne Modesty
<br/>  Hath got such roote in easy waxen harts
<br/>  That Men may not themselues ther owne good parts
<br/>  Extoll, withhout suspect of Surquedry.
<br/>  For but thy selfe no Subiect can be found
<br/>  Worthy thy quill, nor any quill resound
<br/>  Thy worth but thyne: how good it weare to see
<br/>  A poeme in thy prayse and writt by thee.
<br/>  Now if this Song be to'harsh for ryme, yet as
<br/>  The Painters bad God made a good deuill
<br/>  T'will be good prose, although the verse be euill,
<br/>  If thou forget the ryme as thou dost pas.
<br/>  Then wryte that I may follow, and so bee
<br/>  Thy debtor, thy'Eccho, thy foyle, thy Zanee.
<br/>  I shall be thought, if myne like thyne I shape
<br/>  All the Worlds Lyon though I be thy Ape.
