<strong>To Mr. T. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Hast thee harsh Verse as fast as thy lame measure
<br/>  Will giue thee leaue, to him my payne and pleasure.
<br/>  I haue giuen thee, and yet thou art to weake,
<br/>  Feete, and a reasoning Soule and tong to speake.
<br/>  Plead for me, and so by thyne and my labor,
<br/>  I ame thy Creator, thou my Sauior.
<br/>  Tell him all questions which Men haue defended
<br/>  Both of the place and paynes of hell are ended.
<br/>  And tis decreed that hell is but priuation
<br/>  Of him, at least in this Earths habitation.
<br/>  And tis wher I ame, wher in euery streete
<br/>  Infections follow, overtake and meete.
<br/>  Live I, or dy, by you my Love is sent
<br/>  And you are my pawnes or els my testament.
