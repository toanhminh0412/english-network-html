<strong>T. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  At once from hence my lines and I depart,
<br/>  I to my soft still walks, they to my hart,
<br/>  I to the nource, they to the childe of art.
<br/>  Yet as a firme house, though the Carpenter
<br/>  Perish, doth stand: As an Embassador
<br/>  Lyes safe how ere his King be in danger
<br/>  So though I languish prest with melancholy
<br/>  My vers the strict Map of my misery
<br/>  Shall live to see that for whose want I dy.
<br/>  Therfore I envy them and do repent
<br/>  That from vnhappy me, things happy are sent.
<br/>  Yet as a picture or bare sacrament
<br/>  Accept these lynes and if in them ther bee
<br/>  Meritt of love, bestow that love on me.
