<strong>T. W.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Pregnant againe with th'old twinnes Hope and Feare
<br/>  Oft have I askd for thee, both how and where
<br/>  Thou wert, and what my hopes of letters were,
<br/>  As in our streetes sly beggers narowly
<br/>  Marke motions of the givers hand and ey
<br/>  And evermore conceive some hope therby.
<br/>  And now thyne alms is given, thy letter's red
<br/>  The body risen againe, the which was ded
<br/>  And thy poore starveling bountifully fed.
<br/>  After this banquet my soule doth say Grace
<br/>  And praise thee for'it, and zealously embrace
<br/>  Thy love, though I thinke thy love in this case
<br/>  To be as gluttons, which say midst ther meate
<br/>  They love that best of which they most do eate.
