<strong> H. W. in Hibernia belligeranti</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Went you to conquer? and haue so much lost
<br/>  Your self, that what in you was best and most
<br/>  Respectiue frendship should so quickly dye?
<br/>  In publique gaine my share is not such, that I
<br/>  Would loose your loue for Ireland: better cheap
<br/>  I pardon death (who though hee do not reap
<br/>  Yet gleanes hee many of our frends away)
<br/>  Then that your waking mind should bee a pray
<br/>  To Letargies. Lett shotts and boggs, and skeines
<br/>  With bodies deale, as fate bidds or restreynes;
<br/>  Ere sicknesses attach, yong death is best;
<br/>  Who payes before his death doth scape arest.
<br/>  Lett not your soule (at first) with graces filld
<br/>  And since and thorough crooked lymbecks, stild
<br/>  In many schooles and courts, which quicken it,
<br/>  It self vnto the Irish negligence submit.
<br/>  I aske not labored letters which should weare
<br/>  Long papers out: nor letters which should feare
<br/>  Dishonest cariage: or a seers Art
<br/>  Nor such as from the brayne come, but the hart.
