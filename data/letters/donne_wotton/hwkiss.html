<strong> To Mr. Henry Wotton </strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Sir, More then kisses, Letters mingle Soules:
<br/>  For thus, frinds absent speake. This ease controules
<br/>  The tediousnes of my Life: But for these
<br/>  I could Ideate nothing which could please:
<br/>  But I should wither in one day and pas
<br/>  To'a bottle of hay, that ame a Lock of gras.
<br/>  Life is a voyage; and in our Lifes wayes
<br/>  Cuntryes, Courts, Towns, are Rocks or Remoraes.
<br/>  They breake, or stop all ships, yet our state is such
<br/>  That though then pitche they staine worse we must touch.
<br/>  If in the furnace of the euen Line
<br/>  Or vnder th'aduerse Icy Poles thou pine,
<br/>  Thou knowest two temperate regions girded in
<br/>  Dwell there: But, oh, what refuge canst thou win
<br/>  Parch'd in the Court, and in the Cuntry frozen?
<br/>  Shall Cityes built of both extreames be chosen?
<br/>  Can Dung and Garlick be'a perfume?  Or can
<br/>  A Scorpion and Torpedo cure a Man?
<br/>  Cityes are worst of all three; Of all three
<br/>  (O knotty riddle) each is worst equally.
<br/>  Cityes are Sepulchers; They who dwell there
<br/>  Are Carcases as if no such ther were.
<br/>  And Courts are Theaters, where some men play
<br/>  Princes; some slaues; all to'one end and of one Clay.
<br/>  The Cuntry is a Desert, where no Good
<br/>  Gaind, as Habitts, not borne, is vnderstood.
<br/>  There Men become Beasts, and prone to more euills,
<br/>  In Cityes, blocks, and in a lewd Court, Deuills.
<br/>  As in the first Chaos, confusedlie
<br/>  Each Elements qualityes were in th'other three,
<br/>  So Pride, Lust, Couetise, being seuerall
<br/>  To these three places, yet all are in all.
<br/>  And mingled thus, ther issue incestuous.
<br/>  Falshood is denizend; Vertu is barbarous.
<br/>  Let no Man say there, Vertues flinty wall
<br/>  Shall Lock Vice in me; I'le do none, but know all.
<br/>  Men are Spunges, which to powre out receive;
<br/>  Who know false play, rather then loose, deceive.
<br/>  For in best vnderstandings, Sinne began;
<br/>  Angels sinn'd first, then Deuills, and then Man.
<br/>  Only perchance Beasts sinne not; Wretched wee
<br/>  Are Beasts in all, but whight integritee.
<br/>  I thinke, yf Men, which in these places live
<br/>  Durst looke for themselues, and themselues retrive,
<br/>  They would like Strangers greete themselues, seeing than
<br/>  Vtopian Youthe, growne old Italian.
<br/>  Be then thyne owne home; And in thy selfe dwell;
<br/>  Inne anywhere; Continuance maketh Hell.
<br/>  And seeing the Snayle, which euery where doth rome
<br/>  Carying his own house still, still is at home,
<br/>  Follow (for he is easy pac'd) this Snayle,
<br/>  Be thyne own Pallace, or the World is thy Gayle.
<br/>  And in the Worlds Sea, do not like Corke sleepe
<br/>  Vpon the Waters face; Nor in the Deepe
<br/>  Sinck like a Lead without a Lyne; But as
<br/>  Fishes glide leauing no print wher they pas,
<br/>  Nor making Sound, So closely thy Course go,
<br/>  Let Men dispute whether thou breathe or no.
<br/>  Only in this one thing be no Galenist. To make
<br/>  Courts hott Ambitions holesome, do not take
<br/>  A Dram of Cuntryes dullnes, do not add
<br/>  Correctives, but, as Chimicks, purge the badd.
<br/>  But, Sir, I aduise not you; I rather do
<br/>  Say ore those Lessons, which I learnd of you.
<br/>  Whome, free from Germaine Schismes, and lightnes
<br/>  Of France, and fayre Italyes faythlesnes,
<br/>  Hauing from these suckd all they had of worthe
<br/>  And brought home that Faythe, which you caryed forthe,
<br/>  I throughly Love. But if my selfe I'haue wonne
<br/>  To know my Rules, I haue, and you haue
<br/> Donne.
