<strong>To Mister Henry Wotton 20 Iuly. 1598. At Court.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>  Here is no more newes then Vertu:'I may as well
<br/>  Tell you Calis, or St. Michels tale for newes, as tell
<br/>  That Vice doth here habitually dwell.
<br/>  Yet as to get stomacks we walke vp and downe
<br/>  And toyle to sweeten rest, so may God frowne
<br/>  If but to lothe both, I haunt Court or towne.
<br/>  For here no one is, from th'extremitee
<br/>  Of Vice by any other reason free,
<br/>  But that the next to'him still is worse then hee.
<br/>  In this worlds warrfare they whome rugged Fate
<br/>  (Gods Commissary) doth so throughly hate
<br/>  As in the Courts Squadron to Marshall their State;
<br/>  If they stand arm'd with seely honestee
<br/>  With wishing prayers, and neat integritee
<br/>  Like Indians gainst Spanish hostes they bee.
<br/>  Suspitious boldnes, to this place belongs;
<br/>  And to'haue as many eares as all haue tongs;
<br/>  Tender to know; tough to acknowledge wrongs.
<br/>  Beleeue me, Sir, in my Youths giddiest dayes,
<br/>  When to be like the Court was a Playes prayse,
<br/>  Playes were not so like Courts, as Courts are like playes.
<br/>  Then let vs at these Mimick Antiques ieast
<br/>  Whose deepest Proiects, and egregious gests
<br/>  Are but dull Morals of a game at Chests.
<br/>  But now tis incongruity to smile.
<br/>  Therfore I end: And bid farwell awhile;
<br/>  At Court; though, From Court, were the better stile.
