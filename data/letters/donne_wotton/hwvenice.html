<strong> To Sir Henrie Wotton, at his going Ambassadour to Venice. </strong>
<br/>
<br/>  After those reuerend Papers, whose soule is
<br/>  Our Good, and Great Kings lou'd hand, and fear'd name;
<br/>  By which to you hee deriues much of his
<br/>  And (howe hee may) makes you almost the same,
<br/>  A Taper of his Torch, A Coppie writt
<br/>  From his Originall; and a faire beame
<br/>  Of the same warme, and dazeling Sun, though it
<br/>  Must in another sphere his virtue streame:
<br/>  After those learned Papers which your hand
<br/>  Hath stor'd with notes of vse, and pleasures too
<br/>  From which ritch Treasurie you may Command
<br/>  Fitt matter, whether you will write, or doe:
<br/>  After those louing Papers, where Friends send,
<br/>  With glad griefe to your Sea-ward stepps, farewell
<br/>  Which thicken on you nowe, as prayers ascend
<br/>  To Heau'n in troopes, at a good mans passing Bell:
<br/>  Admitt this honest Paper, and allowe
<br/>  It such an Audience, as your self would aske;
<br/>  What you must saye at Venice, this meanes nowe
<br/>  And hath for Nature what you haue for taske:
<br/>  To sweare much loue; not to bee chaung'd before
<br/>  Honour alone will to your ffortune fitt
<br/>  Nor shall I then honour your fortune more
<br/>  Then I haue done your noble wanting it.
<br/>  But t'is an easier load (though both oppresse)
<br/>  To want, then Gouerne Greatness; for wee are
<br/>  In that our owne, and only buisiness,
<br/>  In this wee must for others Vices care.
<br/>  T'is therefore well your spiritts nowe are plac'd
<br/>  In their last furnace, in Actiuity,
<br/>  Which fitts them (Schooles, and Courts, and warres or'epast)
<br/>  To touch, and Test in any best degree.
<br/>  For mee, (if there bee such a thinge as I)
<br/>  Fortune (if there bee such a thing as shee)
<br/>  Spies, that I beare soe well her Tyranny
<br/>  That shee thinks nothing els soe fitt for mee.
<br/>  But though shee part vs, To heare my ofte prayers
<br/>  For your increase, God is as neare me heare
<br/>  And to send you what I shall begg, his staires
<br/>  In length, and ease, are alike euery where.
