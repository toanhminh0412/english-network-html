<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>
    While he wrote verse letters for other patrons (e.g., Magdalen Herbert), Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, was
    Donne’s longest and most prominent patron, and in some ways, she was the ideal patron for a writer like Donne. The
    Lady Bedford received a considerable education that included training in Italian, French, Spanish, and possibly
    Latin and even Greek.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  She also collected classical artifacts such as
    coins, paintings, music, and masques, and she
    was a patron of the arts and learning who included many famous poets in her circle including Ben Jonson, Michael
    Drayton, and Samuel Daniel.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  John Donne became the Lady Bedford’s client
    around 1607, and the pair had a close
    relationship in which she also wrote poetry that Donne read.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

    Donne wrote nine surviving verse letters to Lucy; three times more than he wrote to anyone else. Many of these
    poems use religious imagery to describe his patron in hyperbolic terms as a divine figure who represents virtue,
    learning, and holiness. This is ironic since evidence suggests that the eventual end of their patronage relationship
    may have been on account of Donne’s taking holy orders; it is possible that the Lady Bedford’s puritan leanings as
    a Calvinist from a devout protestant family made her reluctant to endorse someone with Donne’s past from becoming a
    part of the Church.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>  Whatever the reason, Lucy and Donne’s relationship
    seems to have cooled by 1615, though there
    is no record of any real hostility from that point to Lucy’s death in 1627. Whatever the reason for its end, their
    relationship is a prime example of the patronage system in Early Modern England, and the patronage circle the Lady
    Bedford created served as a refuge for Donne when the English Court was still rather inaccessible to him.
