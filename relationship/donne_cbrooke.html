    <h1>Relationship</h1>
    <p>All extant evidence suggests that Christopher Brooke was John Donne’s oldest and closest friend.
        Unfortunately for scholars, the written record of that friendship is relatively sparse because Donne and
        Brooke lived quite close to one another for much of their lives: the two shared chambers at Lincoln’s
        Inn (where they first met) and lived across the street from one another on Drury Lane in London from 1617
        until Brooke’s death.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  Brooke was witness to John Donne’s wedding to
        Anne (Brooke’s brother, Samuel, officiated)
        and was imprisoned for his involvement. Donne and Brooke’s intimate friendship appears to have carried on until
        Brooke’s death. In the version of Brooke’s will recorded in The Complete Poems of Christopher Brooke, the author
        bequeaths certain paintings to Donne among a list of Brooke’s family and close friends: “I giue vnto my deere
        ancient and worthie friend Dcor Dunn the Deane Pawles my picture of the ladie Elizabeth her grace the Countesse
        of Southampton, my lady Anne Wallop, and my lady Isabella Smith.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
        That Donne appears in a list among Brooke’s
        closest friends and family as a recipient of even a portion of Brooke’s estate, along with the language of “my
        deere ancient and worthie friend” that Brooke uses to describe Donne, demonstrates just how closely connected
        the pair stayed throughout their lives.     </p>
<p>In many ways, Christopher Brooke was able to achieve the secular career to which Donne aspired. After attending
    university, possibly at Cambridge, Brooke was deeply involved with Lincoln’s
    Inn almost until death.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
    Brooke served as the representative for York for over two decades as an active and vocal member of parliament.
    He was also a member of the Virginia company: he invested in the Company and became a member of its council in
    1609, and he provided legal counsel and political advocacy until the company’s dissolution in
    1624.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>   Donne was
    himself an honorary member of the council of the Virginia Company and, though he never held shares in the company,
    he delivered a sermon to the Virginia Company in 1622.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Brooke, like Donne and Jonson, was also a member of the Sirenaical society that attended the Mermaid tavern.
    The majority of Brooke’s verse seems to have a political bent: among other politically charged poems like his
    Poem on the Late Massacre in Virginia, Brooke is credited as having co-written “The Parliament Fart,” a topical
    libel on Henry Ludlow that was popular among verse collectors, and his Legend of Richard the Third is a warning
    against monarchical overreach.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In addition to two of Donne’s most popular verse letters, Storm and Calm, Donne wrote the less-known CB to
    Christopher Brooke as well. All three of these poems to Brooke invoke Donne’s affection for him and allude to
    how unaccustomed the pair are to be separated. Storm in particular notes how badly Donne simultaneously wishes
    to see his friend but also keep him from harm. Donne’s correspondence, while not comprehensive, is an artifact
    embodying an intimate friendship. </p>

        Wotton, George Garrard, and Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford), but none played so active a role as Brooke. It
        is possible that the presence of these friends in the Company and its council contributed to Donne’s honorary
        membership and his opportunity to deliver a sermon to the Company.
