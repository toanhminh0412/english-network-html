<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Sir Henry Goodere was an intimate friend of John Donne’s for twenty-five years.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  Their professional interests
    overlapped as both Goodere and Donne sought similar civic posts in their early careers, and both served as members
    of parliament (Goodere in 1604, Donne in 1601 and 1614). Goodere enjoyed moderate wealth and success for much of
    his life, but these achievements were usually outpaced by his spending habits. He received the Polesworth estate
    through marriage to his first cousin, Frances Goodere, and was a gentleman of the privy chamber during the reign
    of King James I and VI, as well as a minister of parliament.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Goodere received a knighthood while in service to
    Robert Devereux, the second Earl of Essex (the very same Earl of Essex who led the naval expeditions Donne
    participated in), and was an attendant to the Earl of Hertford during an embassy to Brussels. Despite these
    preferments and opportunities, Goodere lived an expensive lifestyle that saw him in debt at the end of his life:
    Lucy Russell aided by paying part of the dowry for her god-daughter (Henry’s daughter), Lucy Goodere, and John
    Donne even helped pay for the debts of Goodere’s son, John, after the latter had been
    imprisoned.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  Goodere shared
    many friends and associates in common with Donne, including the poet’s patron Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford,
    and Donne’s close friend, Christopher Brooke.
</p>

<p>Sir Henry Goodere was one of Donne’s closest friends and particulars of their relationship survive in a
    well-documented correspondence.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>  Among other indications of their intimacy is the fact that Goodere was willing
    to have Donne compose prose letters on his behalf (and Donne was happy to do so), and that Donne frequently
    conveyed his letters and packets for Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, through
    Goodere.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>   Around fifty letters
    from Donne to Goodere are extant, including a verse letter, HG. The pair even co-authored a unique verse letter,
    “Since every tree begins” (AltVic) written alternis vicibus (in alternating stanzas) to Lucy Russell and one of
    her friends. Their correspondence serves as a testament to their friendship: though Goodere spent a great deal of
    time in Warwickshire, he and Donne shared a weekly correspondence for over half a decade and their friendship
    appears to have lasted from as early as 1602 to Goodere’s death in 1627.
