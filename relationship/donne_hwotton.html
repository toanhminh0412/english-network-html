<h2>Relationship</h2>
    <p>Sir Henry Wotton was another one of Donne’s lifelong friends and their careers had similar trajectories until
        Donne’s career prospects plummeted upon his marriage to Anne More. Wotton served as secretary to the Earl of
        Essex during his exile but before his rebellion, and this secretaryship overlapped with Donne’s own service as
        secretary to Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper. As a result, though they likely met at Oxford during their teenage
        years, Wotton and Donne would have crossed paths professionally as their respective masters had close
        associations with one another and both Egerton and Essex were members of Queen Elizabeth’s
        star chamber.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
        Like Donne, Wotton participated in the 1596 Cadiz expedition and Essex’s expedition to the Azores in 1597.</p>

    <p>Wotton and Donne’s extant correspondence is significant in that it includes verse letters written by both parties
        as well as prose.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Donne wrote four verse letters to Wotton (more than any other close friend), including the
        famously popular “Sir, More then Kisses” (HWKiss), as well as over a dozen prose
        letters.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> One extant verse
        letter from Wotton to Donne survives, as well as four potential prose letters.  Their correspondence is an
        excellent witness to their friendship and their verse letter exchange in particular displays Donne exercising
        the rhetoric of friendship during a tumultuous time in English politics as many of the poems here relate to the
        Earl of Essex’s exile and subsequent rebellion.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> </p>
