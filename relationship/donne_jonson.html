<h2>Relationship</h2>

<p>
Ben Jonson was a close friend to John Donne for much of his life and one of the few of Donne’s associates whose comments
    on Donne survive (apart from elegies). A near contemporary of Donne’s, Jonson also came from a similar background
    as his friend. The son of a London tradesman, Jonson’s biological father died when he was young and he took on the
    trade of his mother’s new husband, working as a bricklayer at various times
    throughout his life.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  Jonson eventually left that trade to pursue a career as a dramatist and
    poet. Jonson was distinct from his contemporaries in that he actually sought and curated his persona as a published
    author when there was still stigma attached to professional writers. Donne, for
instance, frequently voiced his resistance to print publication.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
Jonson and Donne shared considerable overlap in
their social and literary circles despite this difference: both were members of the Sirenaical society (a fraternity
containing significant Renaissance writers), and both were clients under the patronage of Lucy Russell, Countess of
Bedford.</p>
<p>The friendship between Jonson and Donne, along with their similar origins, makes a comparison of these two poets a
    useful exercise that can highlight their differences as writers. Jonson’s writing hinges upon a conservative
    neoclassicism that features an almost slavish faithfulness to the models of Roman poets, especially Horace. Donne
    rules over the “monarchy of Witt” and demonstrates a talent for innovation in his metaphysical conceits. Praise of
    Jonson, on the other hand, describes him as an “innovator” for how fully he can follow the models set by the
    Ancients.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  One might consider it odd that Jonson does not demonstrate
    a greater affinity for Ciceronian models
    in his writing, but his foremost preoccupation was in achieving status as a poet and dramatist, and Cicero’s
    influence is primarily as a political rhetorician and prose writer. Jonson’s models were therefore classical writers
    like Horace and Martial. There are significant distinctions between Donne and Jonson in this regard: Jonson
    self-curated his works as a published author in print, while Donne makes it clear in private correspondence that he
    was reluctant to seek print publication of his poetry and instead aspired to civic and political success. In other
    words, Jonson adheres to the models of Horace and other Roman poets and dramatists because his aspirations are
    literary; Donne leans more heavily into certain rhetorical models of Cicero because many of his motivations are
    overtly civic, political, and above all, social.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> </p>

<p>Donne and Jonson wrote verse about each other that suggests their relationship was one of admiration and respect.
    Donne wrote dedicatory verse for Jonson commemorating Jonson’s play, Volpone, and Jonson wrote two epigrams on
    Donne. Moreover, Jonson references Donne in his recorded conversations with William Drummond of Hawthornden more
    than any other author.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>  Despite the somewhat flippant nature of
    Jonson’s comments in his dialogue with Drummond,
    these works leave us with every indication that Donne and Jonson shared a close friendship and mixed in many of
    the same social and literary groups, making them excellent comparators and counterpoints to one another as
    writers.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>    </p>

<p>Though no extant correspondence between Donne and Jonson survives, each of these writers’ works experienced a kind of
    literary sociability with the other as they frequently circulated in the same manuscripts and literary circles.
    That compilers and readers associated these authors with one another is clear and provides further context for the
    perception of Donne’s verse letters. The poems presented here are dedicatory works in which each poet characterizes
    and praises the literary qualities of the other.</p>

    It is difficult to ascertain just how long Jonson laboured as a bricklayer. He certainly endured abuses about his
    background as late as 1633 and paid his dues to the Company of Tylers and Bricklayers as late as 1611. However,
    there are debates as to whether this membership was due to a need to complement his income from the theatre or
    merely an avenue to further his social status. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

<sup id="fn2">2. See a 1614 letter from Donne to Sir Henry Goodere, where he writes that he only seeks to print his
    letters “under an unescapable necessity” and describes himself as “a Rhapsoder of mine own rags” for printing only
    “a few Copies” (no. 147, 393-95).
