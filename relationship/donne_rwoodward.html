<h2>Relationship</h2>

<p>Rowland Woodward was one of Donne’s closest friends and their relationship lasted the majority of their
    lives.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    Woodward was born the eldest of eight children in London in August of 1573, in the same city and within
    the same year as Donne.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Woodward and Donne most likely met at Lincoln’s
    Inn, which Woodward entered in 1591. </p>

<p> Apart from the verse letters Donne wrote to Woodward (and the verse letter he potentially wrote to Donne), Rowland
    Woodward is perhaps most well known in Donne studies as the scribe of the Westmoreland Manuscript (NY3), a
    manuscript collection of Donne’s poetry containing over 100 of his poems. Little of Rowland Woodward’s own verse
    survives but, along with whatever poems he may have written to Donne, he also composed poems in English to
    commemorate the birth of Charles II and four Latin poems: his own epitaph, an epitaph upon the death of Sir
    Edward Rosseter, and two others.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In addition to fostering a friendship with Donne, Woodward also shared many of the poet’s friends. For instance, he
    served as Sir Henry Wotton’s secretary during the latter’s ambassadorship to Venice starting in 1604 and Donne was
    friends with and wrote verse letters to Rowland’s younger brother, Thomas.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
    Rowland also seems to have had some acquaintance and perhaps even a friendship with Ben Jonson,
    to whom he gave a copy of a book by Petrus Bertius. <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
    In his correspondence with Sir Thomas Roe—another mutual friend—Woodward expresses to Roe that from London he
    might give Roe news of mutual friends. Woodward’s communication with Roe intimates to Woudhuysen that the two
    likely “moved in similar circles” and perhaps shared an association with the ‘Sireniacs’, one-time literary
    patrons of the Mermaid Tavern of which Donne was a member.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Given the available evidence, Donne’s verse letters to Rowland Woodward, very likely written during their Inns of
    Court days, are the familiar correspondence of close friends who had every reason to honestly communicate with one
    another in friendship while challenging each other intellectually. And, as we shall see, the verse letters these
    men shared, particularly Donne’s RWSlumb, support the idea of Woodward and Donne as closely connected friends
    challenging and elevating one another.</p>
