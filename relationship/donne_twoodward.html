<h2>Relationship</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we know relatively little about Donne’s relationship with Thomas Woodward outside that it began when
    both were quite young, and that Donne was also friends with Thomas’s brother, Rowland. Thomas is also likely around
    four or five years younger than Donne as well. </p>

<p>We also know a bit more about this poetic exchange. Scholars have asserted for more than a century that the order
    of the poems present in the Westmoreland Manuscript (NY3), of which Rowland Woodward was the scribe, is quite
    possibly authorial.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  That manuscript arranges Donne’s poems to “T. W.”
    in the following order: the longer TWHail comes first, followed by the three sonnets, TWHarsh, TWPreg, and TWHence.
    Thomas Woodward’s own verse letter to Donne, “Thou sendst me prose and rimes”, appears between TWHail and TWHarsh.
    Likely dating to Donne’s late teens or early twenties, Donne’s verse letters mingle spiritual desire and Donne’s
    need for spiritual sustenance through his friends with a dramatic sense of urgency and helplessness that persists
    throughout the correspondence. Woodward’s verse letter contrasts Donne’s poems, focusing instead on the recipient’s
    overwhelming poetical power. </p>

<p>While religion abounds in Donne’s verse letters to friends (as only makes sense for someone who so closely identifies
    religion with friendship and who relied on friendship for both material and spiritual sustainment throughout much of
    his life), Donne’s sonnet epistles to Thomas Woodward are unique as an example of a sustained use of religious
    symbolism in an ongoing exchange that gives us a rare glimpse into how a reader might respond to such intense and
    vivid poetry.</p>
