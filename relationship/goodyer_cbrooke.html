<h2>Henry Goodere and Christopher Brooke</h2>
<p>Beyond sharing John Donne as a friend, both Henry Goodere and Christopher Brooke appear in the <i>Convivium
    Philosiphicum</i></p> as those in attendance during a dinner of the Sireniacal Society of the Mermaid Taven, of
which they were likely members (along with Donne).
